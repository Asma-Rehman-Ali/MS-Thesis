{"context": "It's super frilly and full of useless bells and whistles, while simultaneously being unintuitive and difficult to effectively program. It actually audibly talks to you and excitedly tells you the DPI setting every time you adjust it, and sometimes interrupts you to loudly exclaim that you won a 'trophy', which is like useless steam achievements for things like milestone number of button clicks or scrolls. It took some tinkering to figure out how to map the mouse buttons in such a way that games would recognize them as \"BUTTON 4\", \"BUTTON 5\" etc... because the control panel only identifies button mappings by generic windows and browser commands. I am really enjoying this mouse. I had a razor mamba that buttons were wearing out on. This mouse interested me partially because reviewers were saying it was a big mouse. My grip has typically been a claw or claw/palm hybrid because of my big hands. But this mouse is large enough and has the correct contours to let me effectively use a straight palm grip and I am loving it.The driver software has also taken my by surprise. The interface is setup well and has plenty of customization options.The lift distance one this mouse is the best I have seen on a laser sensor mouse. It has mostly a mat finish all around except the glossy strips where the LED's are. One thing that i noticed that was pretty obvious is that using this mouse it is kinda large, I have a glove size medium and this mouse is a little bit to big someone with a large size hands would be perfect for this, I can still claw it a little fits great when I palm it but maybe if my hands were a little larger would be even better. The mat finish on top feels great no slipping, but I've seen that this mouse makes my palm sweat a little more then my other mouse without a mat finish on top, Idk what it might be could be the mouse gets a little warmer due to the LED's or just the material. It fits very well in my hand and the button and the scroll wheel is just phenomenal. Though, this doesn't really worksPros:- Very nice and ergonomic design- Very comfortable to medium to large hands- Easy Shift systems gave the mouse ability to do 20+ different task without adding too much buttons that makes many gaming mouse looks ugly. (At least for me)- The led is an appreciated feature- Software is a very powerful tool.- The voice over feature, when you change DPI in game or mode in game, is very useful especially when you ple FPS game and you change DPI often for aiming.- The texture is comfortable even if your hand sweat a lot.- The buttons are very deliberateCons:- It is not really for a small hand because it might feel bulky.- Even without the additional weights the mouse is already a rather heavy mouse heavier than DeathAdderIf you were a medium to large hand person, don't like hundreds of buttons on your mouse, and prefer heavier mouse; this mouse is for you. The XTD does. Every surface you spend time with your hand on is a very soft, almost felt-like rubberized surface. There's a notch for your thumb under the forward/back buttons that's surprisingly comfortable in a claw grip. All of the buttons click very nicely--neither too hard nor too soft, and just enough tactile and audible feedback to let you know it registered. The mouse wheel feels every bit as good as ROCCAT advertises, and their website would indicate that they are absolutely in love with it.", "qas": [{"id": 10, "question": "How big is this mouse?

Confession: This is the first mouse I've actually ever purchased. Every other mouse I've had was a free cheapo mouse that are included when you buy a new computer. I honestly could not go back to a compact mouse after this and I am seriously considering buying a second one to use at work. I love being able to rest my whole hand on the mouse and I never get hand cramps any more. As much as a don't like flashy LED's, I actually have been using the built in LED's, usually set to green with no pulsing/breathing. I'm also not a big fan of the side lights, so I keep them turned off.Overall, this mouse is top tier - but it better be for it's cost. Pros:This thing is rock-solid, the feel of it weighted makes for excellent control of movement. The Sensor is amazing how smooth and accurate it is. On the fly adjustments and an enourmous amout of choices in custom button assignments. No external software needed, except to update the firmware, it's all built into the mouse. The cord has a braided cord wrap. The LED effects, can be turned off, are pretty sweet and very customize-able. A nice bit of Bling on an incredible mouse that doesn't break the bank.Cons: Only one con, It talks, announcing DPI changes, nice to know if you accidentally did it, but could be better implemented. Mouse just died today. Started with one button not working, then it died completely. No lights, completely dead. Tried another computer same thing. I put in a ticket on their support site. Disappointing for a $80 mouse to last 5 months. Will see how the support process goes!UpdateGot a response from support today. They recommended reseting the driver in the roccat control panel. It worked. Went from dead mouse to working mouse.

Sucks. It's something to do with the tracking laser sensor. If it isn't a solid color, the pointer tends to jump around erratically and without warning. Easily remedied, currently using a training manual, from work, that just so happened to be on hand (probably replaced by the time you're reading this).Finally my biggest complaint. Whenever you enable one of the features or adjust a setting with a mouse button, you'll get an obnoxious, loud, and intrusive notification. Late night browsing, I scroll-wheel click a link and get a blaring announcement that rattled my nerves. Mouse just died today. Started with one button not working, then it died completely. No lights, completely dead. Tried another computer same thing. I put in a ticket on their support site. Disappointing for a $80 mouse to last 5 months. Will see how the support process goes!UpdateGot a response from support today. They recommended reseting the driver in the roccat control panel. It worked. Went from dead mouse to working mouse. A little odd since I didn't make any setting changes before and it was also dead on other machines. ROCCAT's level of investment in quality can also be reflected through their design of website, video advertising, customer support, and the solid five star happiness of a vast majority of the customers.For mac users, the question is... Should I get it even though the hardcore gaming functionality is unacceptably incompatible? If you like pretty colors, yes. Definitely get it, and wait and have hope for the next update.Get it, and complain to Roccat. in fact get all your friends to get it and slap Roccat on the face to pressure them to prioritize Mac users happiness I like it, but the interface adjustments are complicated. I don't use it at a level high enough to take advantage of all the features. I like the Razer a bit better but the finger strips warp over time making the clicks either too sensitive or intermittent.

{"context": "This mouse is amazing for me. I came from using a Rzr DA 3500 for the longest time, which was a great mouse and would have purchased another ...but after reading reviews, I decided to give someone else a shot. First I bought an Anker mouse...that was a mistake...not a good mouse or software. I ordered a L-tech G500s and have been using it for awhile. That mouse was just OK, and the software was lacking. I still wanted the feel of the old DA and the control the software provided for configuring it.So after reading all the reviews and youtube videos, I decided to give this a shot. It fits very well in my hand and the button and the scroll wheel is just phenomenal. Though, this doesn't really worksPros:- Very nice and ergonomic design- Very comfortable to medium to large hands- Easy Shift systems gave the mouse ability to do 20+ different task without adding too much buttons that makes many gaming mouse looks ugly. (At least for me)- The led is an appreciated feature- Software is a very powerful tool.- The voice over feature, when you change DPI in game or mode in game, is very useful especially when you ple FPS game and you change DPI often for aiming.- The texture is comfortable even if your hand sweat a lot.- The buttons are very deliberateCons:- It is not really for a small hand because it might feel bulky.- Even without the additional weights the mouse is already a rather heavy mouse heavier than DeathAdderIf you were a medium to large hand person, don't like hundreds of buttons on your mouse, and prefer heavier mouse; this mouse is for you. For my use of the mouse as just a standard one, it works very well. I've not had any problems clicking or with movement.The size and shape of the mouse feels good. I have average to a little bigger male hands, so my pinky drags on the pad, but I've found it helps me control gliding the mouse around better. The buttons are responsive and the range on the the mouse in which you can click (not just the tip) is very nice. My chair/desk setup isn't perfect, so my hand sits back on the mouse due to my desk being too high. This is the first gaming mouse I have purchased and I am very satisfied. I did have a couple of problems when I first installed the mouse and software, but nothing a couple unplug/replug and pc restart didn't resolve.I play all kinds of games from mmo's, to first person shooters, to real-time strategy and mobas. For me, this is the perfect mouse for all of those things. Even for playing an mmo, although there are less buttons that the typical &#34;mmo gaming mouse&#34; the shift key option gives you a lot of fully custom buttons.In terms of feel, responsiveness, weight and size I think all of those things are simply personal preference.

{"context": "(Still looking for a mouse with the 'shift button' customization but a better sensor).TRACKING PRECISION - Now here is where everything falls apart. To put things in perspective, I am not an engineer, nor do I work in electronics, but I am a thorough researcher and tried my best to determine whether this mouse would have the problem so many laser mice do. I read things from legitimate review sites like \"Most accurate mouse we've tested\", and almost every review I read had one of the pros being \"tracking accuracy\". I got this as a replacement for Logitech's G400s (another great mouse, b.t.w) which I had to use elsewhere. I've read many reviews beforehand, especially from people complaining about drivers, firmware, sensor, buttons, etc. so I was prepared to potentially experience some of these, but after a few months of usage I haven't experienced any. The mouse still works perfectly, without broken buttons/scrolling wheel, any noticeable tracking issues (I use Roccat Alumic mousepad which I got long before this mouse) or issues like &#34;hardware acceleration&#34; (I haven't noticed any with latest 1.17 firmware/software). I've read that others thought the wheel gave in over time and while I can tell its not as difficult to scroll as when I got it, it's still not anywhere close to the ease of my last Logitech.I've learned to live with my one complaint of the mouse though and I would purchase this exact mouse again if I needed a new one.

Purchased this alongside a Steelseries Apex. They match famously and look incredible next to each other. On to the functionality, this mouse feels incredible. Hands down best mouse I've ever used. The customizable weight really adds a nice touch and the software it woks with really adds some great functionality. I use for music production not gaming. Sped up my workflow and creative process with avoiding annoying and now unnecessary mouse clicks. The mouse feels great, tracks well, and glides like butter. So why the 3 star review? The drivers are atrocious. You can only adjust dpi to certain predetermined increments, which is ridiculous. Also, the mouse shouts out the dpi setting you are on when you switch on the fly. This is extremely annoying. It also shouts out random \"achievements\" which are completely unnecessary. Additionally, whenever I launch the driver application it bricks the mouse, forcing a restart. Great mouse. Garbage drivers.

{"context": "Now if you go on there website they say \"0 acceleration and 0 jitter\" which is b.sAcceleration definition: \"Without mouse acceleration, the movement of the mouse and the movement of the cross hair will be 1 : 1.With mouse acceleration, the movement is based on speed. Meaning, if you move the mouse 1 inch, slowly, it'll move one distance. If you move it still 1 inch, but fast, it'll move a lot farther. \"If you do some searching around on the internet, you find out this mouse use's a ADNS-9800 sensor NOT . It's super frilly and full of useless bells and whistles, while simultaneously being unintuitive and difficult to effectively program. It actually audibly talks to you and excitedly tells you the DPI setting every time you adjust it, and sometimes interrupts you to loudly exclaim that you won a 'trophy', which is like useless steam achievements for things like milestone number of button clicks or scrolls. It took some tinkering to figure out how to map the mouse buttons in such a way that games would recognize them as \"BUTTON 4\", \"BUTTON 5\" etc... because the control panel only identifies button mappings by generic windows and browser commands. I like it, but the interface adjustments are complicated. I don't use it at a level high enough to take advantage of all the features. I like the Razer a bit better but the finger strips warp over time making the clicks either too sensitive or intermittent. We'll see how this one does in a few months. I really tried to like this mouse. The first one I received had a defective scroll wheel and the right mouse button was overly sensitive and offered no feedback. I ordered another one hoping the first was just a fluke. The second one had the same hair-trigger right mouse button and the scroll wheel would not click down.

{"context": "A good workaround to save space is to install AC2, play it, delete AC2, then install and play ACB.This trilogy only includes all DLC for only AC2, sequences 12 and 13 which were skipped from the original release. There is also no copy of AC1 bundled with Revelations for those wondering.For the uninitiated looking to get into the full story, this is a great package and worth the money. Since all AC2 single player DLC is included, you'll only need to buy Brotherhood's 'Da Vinci Disappearance' DLC and download Corpenicus DLC for free from the PSN store and you'll be straight.Revelations single player DLC, The Lost Archive, sucks and is not worth the money although it has somewhat important information regarding one of the main characters. Brotherhood story continues immediately where AC2 left off and does it brilliantly. Brotherhood introduces the ability to have assassins of your own and boy does it come in handy. This mechanic is almost as much of a game-changer as the ship mechanic in AC3. So fluid, so helpful, so exciting, so much fun.To give each game their own rating out of 10 I would rate them as so;Assassins Creed 2: 8.5 out of 10. Having your own mansion and city to renovate is a fun goal-setter but it could use more options. First off Ezio is by far Assassins Creed's best character in the series so it was a smart idea by ubisoft to milk two other games for him. Both AC2 and Brotherhood are extremely fun and provide a fantastic story and new gameplay elements. Revelations innovates as well but some don't pan out as well as they should such as bomb and bomb-making. Sometimes the bombs come in handy other times its a mess to sort through them all. There were some bright spots in Revelations but it just seemed like they tried to add useful but cluttering elements. I love this franchise. Cool story line, awesome graphix and gameplay. Cant wait for another AC to come out. Thank you. I've played assassins creed 3 before playing any of the others. So I ended up buying them all from amazon. The games are great.

{"context": "Even at $40, this trilogy is still a good deal. If you would rather pay more to have 3 disks and use less HDD space - more power to you!This trilogy only comes with the ACII DLC, but for newcomers to the series, I would recommend reading reviews on DLC for the other 2 games before buying any of it, as many see the added content as not being worth the additional money.As far as the 3 games included, refer to each individual game's product page for full review there. If your looking for a good value this is it. I have fininished the first of three and I am currently playing the second. Has a good story line with plenty if additional side missions to keep it interesting. I also enjoy the puzzles set in the game as you progress. Assassin's Creed is one of my favorite franchises of all time. I rented and beat all three of these when they first came out and I have been waiting for a deal like this. All three of these games are awesome, and $30 for 3 full games is and incredible price. With these I have completed my collection.No dislikes about it, and I love the price.I recommend this product to anyone who likes good stories within their games. I recommend you buy the first Assassin's Creed and Assassin's Creed 3 with these (if you don't already have them), and play the franchise from the beginning. So I was looking forward to this product, than I got it. First off the games are on one disc, but you have to completely install 2 and as if you downloaded the game.

{"context": "Thanks for the warning I guess. Hard drive space is not an issue with me nor is the price tag except I think it should come prepackaged with all available DLC. You're better off downloading off the network since Sony is selling these great games with all the dlc in bundles. Granted 20 to 30 bucks each but when its all said and done, you still pay less considering all the dlc you get; If hard drive space is not an issue with you of course. Go ahead and buy each and every one on disc, you still have to purchase the dlc and end up paying more. Brotherhood story continues immediately where AC2 left off and does it brilliantly. Brotherhood introduces the ability to have assassins of your own and boy does it come in handy. This mechanic is almost as much of a game-changer as the ship mechanic in AC3.

{"context": "Assassin's Creed II and Revelations installed fine, but Brother hood wouldn't install, then I saw a nick on the disc, barely noticeable. So I contacted Amazon, they refunded the price of the disc, and gave me the option to order Brotherhood stand-alone and Assassin's Creed (1) and give me free one-day shipping. All in all, I'm very happy, as usual, with Amazon's service. The only reason for 4 stars is the problem for the installation, reason why I am not able to play the game at all, other than that, happy with the item. No DLC? No notice that it will eat hard drive space like candy? No fixes for the notoriously frustratingly buggy Revelations? 3 strikes it's out.Ezio pack is for people that:* have played or don't care to play AC I& Have 18 GB of HDD free& willing to pay extra for DLC included in individual product& new to AC III and want the backstoryI'm aware game specific patches are something you're going to have to research with Ubisoft.com, before purchase and probably would never be part of the product description. Assassin's Creed 2 comes with some DLC already in there, not all though. You also get a Uplay Passport code, which gets you access to the multiplayer in Revelations and some DLC. So it is probably better to buy it new rather than used, just for the code though. You can install AC 2 and Brotherhood in as many systems as you want. For the ones who are complaining that it does not include all DLC, please be quiet and leave those who are serious about this product alone. All 3 games alone are worth more than $40, so this is a steal. You'll better off looking up info on 'The Lost Archive' and save yourself a few bucks.If Ubi patches this nonsense so you can at least play all games direct from the disc, this would be a solid investment for only $40.

{"context": "When I needed a new mouse, I decided to pay a bit more for a gaming mouse seeing as I game a lot. I wanted the deathadder but my dad suggested against it, since this one was cheaper. When I first got it, it was way too big for me, but I finally got used to it and it was fine. The software that you should install is something I didn't want to touch. It looked like bad software and it is confusing for me to use. I managed to change to color of my mouse though and I liked that I could. The mouse works great for normal usage and for gaming on Linux systems. I've tested it on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, CentOS 6.2 and RedHat 6.4 with no problems, it works great out of the box did not have to install any additional drivers. I have it paired with the CM Storm QuickFire TK keyboard on my Linux systems. Also had no problems when using it with a KVM to switch between my systems including one on an HP docking station. Pros:-Flawless optical engine-NO inherent hardware based acceleration-Tracks extremely well-Adjustable DPI in 4 flavors-5 hardware profiles, 4 able to be customized by user-Color changing LEDs. Mouse wheel, DPI buttons, CM Storm Logo. Able to light each individually with different colors or turn them off and on, continuous light, dimmer, and flash on button presses. color adjustable with RGB and brightness sliders. near infinite combinations. My BF3 profile is Teal and Orange and Torchlight 2 is Primary colors, etc.-Can store 100 profiles on PC and load swap them out to mouse at any time very easily.-Ambidextrous design with 2 thumb buttons on each side of mouse (if you're flexible, you can make use of them) (if you hold the mouse strangely and find yourself inadvertently pressing the opposing side's buttons, you can disable them)-Can program long macros for MMOs-Can adjust LOD (makes a small difference, but it's definitely there)-Can adjust the response time of button clicks-LMB and RMB are Omron switches and feel absolutely amazingScroll wheel is awesome and HUGE, the button requires less force to activate than a Logitech G5 and scrolls better, tooCons (small gripes and nowhere NEAR being game breaker)-rear heavy-software is powerful but not intuitive (takes a few minutes to understand that you NEED to press apply after every change, and profile changes are strange to get accustomed to. I like this mouse a lot.The software, as people said, is a little odd. First of all, you cannot delete or alter the &#34;Default&#34; profile. That's ok, I made two custom profiles and set one of the &#34;DPI&#34; middle buttons to switch between the two. One for gaming, one for OS/Desktop. The default profile includes colors that switch with the DPI level, but in a custom color profile, you can not change color on the fly.The click buttons are hands-down, orgasmic. I also have a Razer Blackwidow keyboard, which has green LEDs, so it kind of disappointed me that you can't change the colors of the profiles around so I can have the red be green to match my keyboard.All in all, it's a great mouse, though it could use some more options for customization, like software or something.

{"context": "The mouse works great, the only problem I have is that every time I begin a session on windows 8 64 bit I need to update the firmware on the mouse using the firmware update software they provide on their site. If I don't do it I get an error: Writedatabegin Failed.It's really annoying.After Upgrading motherboard the mouse works without problems, very good product for the price. The driver / software is very hard to use, with tiny buttons/text and buggy scrolling. Assigning actions to buttons in Windows 8 is a joke. There's hardly any default actions to choose from that are of any use, like Instant Viewer, Charms, App Toggle, etc. You can assign a single keystroke but not a combination which is basically what ANY shortcut is in the OS.It wouldn't track on my smooth desk where every other optical mouse I've used has no problem with. It seems I can only use a dark solid color mouse pad to get good performance with it.I do have the CM Storm QuickFire TK keyboard which works great. It has some of the slickest skates I've ever felt, this mouse is extremely fast!There are two drawbacks, and they are fairly significant. One is that the cord is very thin, reminds me of the old mice that various companies included with their desktops back in the 90s. A gaming mouse should have a braided cord, it essential that the cord not be able to twist or tangle during a fragfest. As such, I sleeved the usb cable for my client and it is tangle free now.

{"context": "Once figured out, though, it's EXTREMELY easy so fear not)-would be great to have fully customizable DPI settings like Logitech mice rather than 800, 1600, 3200, 4000Got the mouse in a week and a half ago. Have been getting used to the shape coming from an ergonomic Logitech G5. Loving 2 thumb buttons on each side. With some minor finger acrobatics I am able to make use of the opposing side's buttons.The shape of this mouse is great, but I am having some growing pains with it since it's ambidextrous and wedge shaped.Think of the Logitech G5s shape lying flat as a half-circle out of the desktop. I think the main issue I usually have with a mouse is its width. I prefer a mouse that's a little bit more ergonomic. The Recon is perfect! I love the color changing LED's and the matte rubberized finish. My only real gripe is the non braided cord.I honestly love this mouse and for the price (30 dollars at the time), wow, just wow. I know there are a lot of Razer and Steelseries fanboy's out there, but I think you really need to give CoolerMaster a chance because they really deliver on this one. -The mouse is fairly well constructed.-Took some time getting used to its hump/bump which is almost on the center of the mouse, which makes it feel im dragging it around with my fingers and not nearly as much with my palm.-It feels accurate enough for gaming, not as much for photoshop (small detailing).-The software is ok but the mouse is limited to preset DPI settings (say 800, you cant go 850 or 910, etc).-Glides great, weight is on the light side.If you have a chance, try this mouse before buying it. Pros: For either right or left handed mousers, pretty colored lights, thumb buttons easier to reach than most mice, smooth rubberized grip on main surface of mouse with a very faint texture on the sides, solid mouse click wheel.Cons: Both buttons on the left and right side of the mouse are identical. This means that there is a mouse4 and mouse5 on both the left and right side of the mouse. This is bad as I can accidentally click one of the buttons on the outside of the mouse during critical moments of a match. Been using it for about a month.

{"context": "It has some of the slickest skates I've ever felt, this mouse is extremely fast!There are two drawbacks, and they are fairly significant. One is that the cord is very thin, reminds me of the old mice that various companies included with their desktops back in the 90s. A gaming mouse should have a braided cord, it essential that the cord not be able to twist or tangle during a fragfest. As such, I sleeved the usb cable for my client and it is tangle free now. But that is why I have taken one star away, it just isn't acceptable for a quality gaming mouse to have such a flimsy tail.The other thing is something I have seen mentioned in other reviews and I experienced this myself; the right side buttons ( I believe button 8 and 9) are too easy to accidentally hit. I bought this mouse as a replacement to an old two button Microsoft mouse. I was looking for a versatile mouse, one that I could game with, photo/video edit with, do my design work with, and was comfortable to use just for basic web browsing.The DPI settings are nice, the extra buttons have come in handy, and the mouse is comfortable to use (I have skinnier hands).Get this mouse if you game AND use your computer for other tasks. It's also under $50.The only CON I can think of for this mouse is the scroll wheel feels odd (not the smoothest spin to it? Really, a great mechanical click. The sidebuttons are totally fine, nothing special. The shape of the mouse is great; it's not huge and as someone with big hands but who plays with a &#34;claw&#34; style it works well for me.I also really appreciate the notched scroll wheel, it feels solid and has a very fluid notched flow. There is no horizontal scroll, but luckily you don't need all four side buttons for &#34;IE Browser Back&#34; functions - I just set one set to horizontal scrolling.The coating seems cool to the touch, and the overal heft of the mouse is medium. prosIt is very comfortable. The pressure you need to click is perfect. the scroll wheel has just the right resistance. I love the colorsconsthe white got a little stained, but its not a big deal, its probably my fault. You can't bind left forward and back keys, and right forward and back keys to separate things (Like forwards keys are bound to the same thing), not that big of a deal seeing as it would be hard to hit the outer side. -The mouse is fairly well constructed.-Took some time getting used to its hump/bump which is almost on the center of the mouse, which makes it feel im dragging it around with my fingers and not nearly as much with my palm.-It feels accurate enough for gaming, not as much for photoshop (small detailing).-The software is ok but the mouse is limited to preset DPI settings (say 800, you cant go 850 or 910, etc).-Glides great, weight is on the light side.If you have a chance, try this mouse before buying it.", "qas": [{"id": 30, "question": "Does this mouse support free-scrolling scroll wheel?

{"context": "Wanted a new mouse, had an already aging Tt eSports Azurures 1600 dpi, while it was good i needed a replacement since it was dying. Got this little mouse for cheap [30 bucks]. The RGB leds are really nice.The mouse doesnt have weights for adjusting it as the azurues thats a reason por 4 stars. Only mouse and manuals are included. You must separately download Recon software for configuring macros and leds. On the other hand, the color customization really shines on this mouse. You have 3 separate LEDs that you can control: the mouse wheel, dpi +/- buttons, and the CM storm logo. And these LEDs can pretty much be set up to any color. The software has 10 large category color schemes, but when you click on one of them, you can vary the amount of red, green and/or blue to create the color your liking.ConclusionOverall nice mouse with solid build and solid feels with a lot of customization. So now let's get to the pros and cons://////////////Pros////////////-Comfortable-precise-fully customization LEDs (As in, the LEDs can be any color you want! )-the buttons feel like they are of good quality, compared to the cheap feel of the buttons on my previous mice from Razer-More DPI Customization than Razer allows-perfect all-around weight for me-tracks very well//////////////Cons////////////-this is more of a personal annoyance, but I'm not used to having buttons on the right side of the mouse, so I accidentally hit them. I also have a Razer Blackwidow keyboard, which has green LEDs, so it kind of disappointed me that you can't change the colors of the profiles around so I can have the red be green to match my keyboard.All in all, it's a great mouse, though it could use some more options for customization, like software or something. For the price, I certainly can't complain, so I'd definitely recommend it. Great mouse at an excellent value.

{"context": "I have an intellectually disabled son who did very well with earlier versions of MS Train Simulator. But this is too confusing due to it's link with Steam. I don't want him online or in chat rooms or selecting other games at Steam. He just needs to be offline and drive trains. You have the option to run offline but the software starts by reminding you you're offline and asks again if you want this. So anytime he starts the game he can override offline and enter Steam online. There are less routes and trains available than previous versions unless, again, you go online and download (sometimes pay) for more routes or engines. I mean EVERYTHING. At that juncture I decided that that was too much information for a solitary program.Why would STEAM need to know what all is on my computers hard drive ?What personal information is being sent back to them ?So I promptly uninstalled Train Sim 2013 and did a system restore to remove any and all traces. I can understand them needing Copy Protection but this carrying it a bit too far and the end-user should not have to log-in to the Internet each and every time to play a video game he or she just purchased at a brick and mortar store. This game is the best one yet, beats any game before. Easy add-ons plenty to choose from. Requires a stream account, that is free! ! I got this for my son for his Birthday along with a new laptop. It was an excellent purchase and I didn't go wrong. On his computer its either Train Simulator, Minecraft, or roblox. Game was in excellent condition and the shipping and packing was excellent. I bought this game after reading the reviews for Train Simulator 2012. I wasn't sure what to expect because I haven't played TS2012. I received the game and have to say that I have some complaints, but overall I have been happy.The games graphics are great and the simulation runs well. I had to install Steam which I wasn't fond of at first but I have been able to adapt.

I have an i7 core computer with 8 GB RAM, and a 2 GB graphics card, with NVIDIA GE Force. I get very modest realism, but the hesitation (fps) is way too slow for it to be great. The throttles and brakes have very specific stop points (e.g. 13%, 25%, 38%, etc.) which makes it very difficult to maintain consistent speed or braking.

Your growing options are wheat, barley, canola, corn, grass (for hay) as well as beets and potatoes.

It is a plug and play USB keyboard, I did not need to install any drivers for it to work with my MSI mother board/AMDFX custom rig.All keyboard functions are accessible by holding the &#34;FN&#34; key located where your right-hand &#34;windows&#34; key would normally be (next to &#34;Alt&#34;) the left &#34;Windows&#34; key is still there if you need it to pull up your Start Menu from a fullscreen program.Usin &#34;FN&#34; and the &#34;8&#34; and &#34;2&#34; on the num pad you can access 4 different light settings. It's a minor adjustment, but if you use Backspace while using the web be prepared to strike the F11 key and send your browser into theater mode more than once. The keys also seem slightly smaller than the average keyboard, not small enough to make it impossible, just slightly tighter. There are also no programmable macro keys, which can be both a good and bad thing, depending on preference. It does come with a key extractor and several clear keys, so you can modify the keyboard slightly to your preferences.This keyboard does have media controls, the standard volume up, down, skip track, previous track, and play/pause, as well as having the LED controls and Windows Key lock all \"Function\"-based. Someone without the same range of little finger extension might have an issue with it, but mine rests square on the key at all times.- The keys all light well, and every key on the board is lit; I've had some backlit keyboards that leave everything but the alphanumeric keys unlit;- In a dark room, the low brightness setting is sufficient to assist key-finding, while the high level is effective even in a lit room; I still find myself sometimes thinking, &#34;Wow, that is bright.&#34;- The lighted windows along the left, right and back side of the keyboard are a nice (and at times surprisingly useful) touch;My only quibble with the keyboard as designed is that the symbols on the top row of number keys are the same size as the numbers, which took some getting used to. This keyboard works great. You can change the dim of the back-lighting and there's a function that disables the Windows key while playing games.

{"context": "A good price for this much plastic and a few LED lights plus a usb dongle is $25.6. The keys are very cheaply made.I am returning this keyboard. The reviews misled me into thinking I was buying a quality product. Oops.I would recommend this keyboard only to light-fingered casual gamers who care for pretty lights with three color options over any other considerations - BUT would hasten to remind them that the logitech boards, which offer full spectrum lighting are only $30 more and I expect you'd get around 4x the material and quality for that price.I've edited this review after calming down a bit to be less offensive than the original after several people found it unhelpful. Sleek, nice LEDs, satisfying click, extra keys, long cable, cool design, low priced, and of course, its blue! Basically, the best keyboard for under 50 dollars. While I can't say that I'm absolutely blown away, it has held up to my nightly gaming rituals and authoring as well as my wife's online schoolwork.The first thing I noticed is that the keyboard itself is very lightweight. I was surprised at just how slim it felt! The cable is approximately four to six feet long, matching the average length for a wired keyboard. Installation is quick and painless -- there are no drivers to install beyond what Windows already has available. Key throws are consistant between the various keys and are reasonably quick and responsive. I was expecting an average cheap keyboard. The price being what it is I didn't expect a super high end keyboard. What I got surprised the heck out of me.I liked it so much and they typing is so quick on it that I purchased a second one. I'm not really a gamer so that wasn't a factor in why I purchased it. I type all day long every day and this keyboard is taking a full 10 -12 hour work out every day I work.

The last is one that I've had for ten (10!) years. For $49.99 a Microsoft Wireless Comfort Keyboard 4000. It came WITH a mouse. I was excited to see how far keyboard technology had come in 10 years and when I read these reviews I was even more excited. Opened the Amazon box and right away noticed several things that aren't mentioned in the reviews or in the description.New info:1. great lit keyboard. for this price you can't go wrong. just wish it was wireless. that would of made it perfect. Then I went to Amazon and almost immediately found what I needed-back-lit, wired and good for both everyday use and with fast response for gaming too. The aesthetics can't be beat-choose blue, purple or red, choose strong to dim or have it pulse. the only thing is my last keyboard was a wave, so ti is taking a little time to get used to the layout. I knew that getting into this purchase. The price is grat and I love this keyboard! NOT A MECHANICAL KEYBOARD!!!!!!!!!!! There are no other features other than the ascetics that could make this a &#34;gaming keyboard&#34;. Now that that's out of the way, this keyboard, for the price is an awesome wired keyboard.

{"context": "I like the feel of the keys, the colors are very nice, everything is well lit; it works as it should.What I don&#8217;t like. I had a media keyboard before, so a few things have been trade-offs. No Sleep button for the computer. The Volume Mute, Up and Down buttons require using the Function button with F1, F2, or F3. The Shift keys aren't printed with the word Shift, just wide up-arrows. The Return Key isn't printed with the word Return, just a return-arrow.The price was outstanding. For the price, this cant be beat...im not a fan of mechanical keyboards and i love the silence of rubber dome ones... especially if im gaming in the night and my sibling is trying to sleep.the lights (all three of them) are very vibrant and make typing or gaming in the night very easy on the high or low setting.build quality is decent, yes it does have some flex...but i mean, what do you expect for the price.im also wondering if has safeguards against spilage; seeing as the keys are elevated and the back of the keyboard has holes that would appear to be for water or liquid to pass through without harming your keyboard.PROS: cheapoverall good looking keyboardwell backlitlazer etched keyspossible spillage protectionCONS: cheapish build (the amount of keyboard flex) .. but again, you could always buy a more expensive keyboardEnglish translation in the manual wasnt that good.... but usable neverthelesskeys have a shiny slippery kind of look.....might be a con for others, doesnt bother me.

{"context": "The keys - Low profile, non-mechanical laptop-like keys. They are thin brittle plastic punched out of plastic sprues. They are not individually molded.

In other words - many of the keys are missing little chunks or have extra little chunks of plastic where they were attached to the mold. For me this is not acceptable in a modern finished product.2. It is very lightweight and slidy. (NOT a good thing in a keyboard IMO - it isn't supposed to move)3. this keyboard is awesome. like many of the other comments i was skeptical when i bought it but i trusted some of the comments and took the plunge anyway. it paid of because this board looks great, feels great and it performs really well. i switched out the WASD keys for the transparent ones and it made the board look even cooler. i got the blue one but im sure the red one is just as cool if not cooler, but i had to stick to my colour scheme. this board is worth the money and it looks really cool, if you can get it i would strongly recommend that you do. Teeny tiny Asian keyboard, the enter key is too small, and some of the key spacing and sizes just doesn't feel right.

That's so super cheap.~It lights up pink, it has a pulsating setting (press Fn + 5, to cycle colors// press Fn + 2 or 8 to increase ,decrease backlight)~The keys are responsive and feel nice for typing.~ it's smaller than my Asus keyboard so shortcuts for my games are easier to press :-DIt's awesome, and has cool writing on it what's not to love? I also found many of the grammar symbols to be very tiny and difficult to see -- some even smudged -- and being a backlit keyboard, the point of it all is being able to see the keys. The backlighting IS pretty, but that's not enough for me personally to put up with uncomfortable keys to type on.For those used to this style of keyboard, it's likely fine.

It took me several years to save enough money on the side to buy a new Wii, when I looked up the Wii I found the Wii Mini. I only needed the gaming capability, I am not a hard core gamer. So far it is a lot of fun and I have not noticed any difference between the Mini and the original Wii. Yes, it could be better with 480p component cables. But, kids and moms will not know the difference. It does have a 16:9 widescreen mode, which makes it all the more bearable.I really wanted to do this review because I saw so many negative reviews from people about this console.

Internet connectivity features are not available as they have taken out and do not show up on the Wii System Settings.The Wii mini console is not compatible with Nintendo GameCube Game Discs or Controllers and Memory Cards.Wii is a trademark of Nintendo. If you are OK with a very stripped down version of the original Wii and do not care for connecting it to the internet this will be OK for you.. But I personally feel an original Wii is a lot better. Older Wii's play Gamecube games,have Gamecube ports for the controllers and built in WIFI. These are stripped down and do not play old Gamecube games. To some people that's OK. But what I don't think is OK is that these do not have WIFI. So if you plan on buying one of these to watch HULU plus,Amazon Prime,Netflix or any kind of instant streaming service you will not be able to. Bought it used and it works fine.

They failed at the Wii U so they decide to take a step backand give life to Wii. SONY failed at the PSP GO then tried again withthe PS VITA that proved to be even more of an epic fail! I am sureSONY will no longer make a HandHeld system again. Nintendo is farbehind in technology to compete with SONY and Microsoft when it comesto the Consoles. With that said Nintendo is the King of the Handheldsand needs to make that their staple and stop making JUNK consoles thatare Over-Priced hence the Wii U.

{"context": "It is fairly boring and repetitive. I got to for the simple play thinking my nieces and nephews might like it too. It probably works for that type of game but it is very repetitive. Co op was a bit of fun though. Some say co op doesn't work but all I did was plug in a second controller chose play as guest and it worked fine. Robo knack is just a helper though, if you mover too slow or fast he goes off screen. So you have to work together. Robo knack and knack shouldn't be able to punch each other though as they can easily knock each other around in a fight. The expert reviewers that rated it in the 50% and below are full of it. This is a great game through and through, especially for a family friendly launch game on PS4.The 2 player co-op has been great. My 4-year old twins are taking turns playing with Dad through the entire campaign on easy. I'm doing all the work, but they can run around and punch/jump randomly with me the whole time since the companion for Knack has unlimited lives and respawns close to Knack if they lag behind.We are having a blast and it's a really good looking game. I think this game is much better than the Metacritic score suggests. It can be a little rough at times and the check points are spread a little thin in parts. However, it's fun and quirky like many of Japan Studio's work. I have run across no bugs and the game runs smooth. This would be a great game to introduce a younger gamer to a solid platformer. Intro:Knack is a platform beat &#8216;em up video game developed by Japan Studio that was released worldwide at the launch of the PlayStation 4. It was developed in cooperation with Mark Cerny, the lead architect of the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita. He is also known for his work on Crash Bandicoot, Jak and Daxter, Spyro the Dragon, and Ratchet and Clank.When it was revealed on February 20th at the PlayStation Meeting, I was more than skeptical about this new &#8220;launch platformer&#8221; title. I've read a few so-so reviews about this game, but the game is a beautiful piece of work. The graphics are great, the game play is great...overall GREAT GAME for all ages.", "qas": [{"id": 91, "question": "would it work on European PS4 ?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1381, "text": "This would be a great game to introduce a younger gamer to a solid platformer."}, {"answer_start": 413, "text": "So you have to work together."}, {"answer_start": 636, "text": "This is a great game through and through, especially for a family friendly launch game on PS4.The 2 player co-op has been great."}, {"answer_start": 1968, "text": "I've read a few so-so reviews about this game, but the game is a beautiful piece of work."}, {"answer_start": 1266, "text": "However, it's fun and quirky like many of Japan Studio's work."}]}]}
{"context": "Knack is an exclusive launch title for the PS4 from SCE Japan Studio, the studio who developed such series as Demon's Souls, Ape Escape, LocoRoco, and Patapon. Knack enlists a charming cast of cartoony characters, of which the most notable is Knack, who is developed to save humanity from the Goblins. Players will battle through a linear, easy to follow campaign and collect a variety of collectibles while solving puzzles and smashing goblins and robots. While comedic in appearance, Knack will provide a challenging experience for all skill levels and ages, and has quite the learning curve as players will quickly find themselves repeating areas over and over to master their strategy. * Not worth new-release cost! * Knack game has no manual, and I can't figure out how to play 2 players. * Online manual just says \"Grab an extra DS4 controller and get a friend to lend a helping hand...\", nothing on how to actually join the game. * After googling and not finding the answer. I figured it out. One of the players HAS to be a PSN account that is logged in. * Knack requires 37 GB to install, yet still requires the disc to play. I had the chance to play this game at target, and boy was it dandy. I really enjoyed the graphics and presentation, next gen is going to be an epic win for us next gen players. Too bad xbox one players are missing out on this incredible exclusive. Xbox one is only getting forza, ryse, dead rising 3, halo 5, and highly anticipated titan fall, but I personally think call of duty will make that game look obsolete. Anyway, back to Knack, I think this game is great for adults, and toddlers alike. I like many at first wrote this game off when I first heard about it and saw some game play footage. Then came the mediocre reviews from critics and players so I paid it no mind. Then I played the demo at a local Gamestop and quickly my opinion changed so I decided why not and bought the game.I can determine very easily that a lot of the reviews that are trashing the game are mostly likely because of the first two chapters which more or less are your training period to get acclimated with the game play mechanics. It's okay... much more of a kids-only game than I had hoped for. I had also hoped the multiplayer would be better... yes you can play two players at the same time on the same screen, but the 2nd player has infinite lives and can't upgrade like the main character can. This might be good if it was kids playing and one was significantly younger than the other. But I'd hoped for more enjoyment out of this game as an adult, and it doesn't deliver very well on that front.", "qas": [{"id": 92, "question": "Hello.

{"context": "Put your brain on hold, don't panic, and play a simple button masher game. This game looks and acts like something from Lego, that's a good thing. For kids, this is a good game; they will probably enjoy playing this. For older players this is a brain on hold distraction. Three of us sat around and switched controllers when somebody died three times. We also had a lot of fun telling the person playing to look here, watch that thing, and try this. The game is a pleasure to watch.Yeah we made up names for the characters, the Doctor is Wozniak. Check out many of the other positive reviews to hear about all of the great parts about Knack. However, one thing I wanted to add to the discussion was about the co-op play. Please if you have the chance, play this co-op! It's a blast to experience with another person (and that person can range from being a complete novice to a gaming veteran). It removes slightly some of the frustration of the game that comes along with re-doing difficult sections over and over again. Nothing beats a fun game with good old classic couch co-op! Please dont skip Knack, its a great, charming game for every hardcore gamer and the whole family, i love it You do have the soundtrack, which isn't anything spectacular, utilizing the surround, but that's about it. The game does utilize the speaker on the DualShock 4 when Knack picks up the small blocks to get bigger. On the whole, I'd say the sound is just so-so, not good, but not bad.Multi-player - I believe the game has some sort of co-op, but I did not use it, and I do not know for sure. However, it does have an asynchronous multi-player component, when you find treasure boxes, you can swap what you found with treasures that people on your friends list found--sometimes, they found better, more rare treasures than you, and you can take what they got instead of what you got. Ok I have to state that this is the best game for a family on PS4 at the moment. Graphics are very good but not stellar. I like how they have included the use of the Dualshock Controller speaker to make the clinking of the relics flying towards knack, Gameplay is solid and encourages multiple play throughs to get the correct gems/relics to transform knack. I also like the commected nature of the game. One interesting feature is when you find a treasure chest it gets you the option to choose what your friends found in the treasure boxes.", "qas": [{"id": 93, "question": "I have two dualshock 4 controllers.

{"context": "It is fairly boring and repetitive. I got to for the simple play thinking my nieces and nephews might like it too. It probably works for that type of game but it is very repetitive. Co op was a bit of fun though. Some say co op doesn't work but all I did was plug in a second controller chose play as guest and it worked fine. Robo knack is just a helper though, if you mover too slow or fast he goes off screen. So you have to work together. Robo knack and knack shouldn't be able to punch each other though as they can easily knock each other around in a fight. Each enemy has a specific attack pattern which is easy enough to memorize but it can get a bit difficult as well when different enemies are mixed together. It'll take a good amount of dodging in some instances to pass certain areas since one or two hits can mean death for Knack.I believe I've read complaints about the difficulty in that respect (one hit kills along with dragged out checkpoints) However, I personally believe this gives Knack that &#34;charm&#34;, that throwback feeling where one hit means death. I read lots of reviews before games come out to help me decide on games to purchase. In the case of Knack, I pre-ordered it long before the rough reviews and I'm not the slightest upset that I did.First of all, I give this game a 5 star for three reasons.First, this game is for all ages. I'm a big fan of many genres of games. Knack is one of those games that is entertaining, fun, and complete with a great story. My kids and myself can play it together and we ALL have such a great time.Second, Knack has a great replay value. I went into this game not knowing what to expect at all. What I came to find was an excellent idea put into a very linear game structure. Now I know some people like a game were there's a set path, with fairly easy to find secrets which is what this game pretty much is. The controls are spot on and the game runs as smooth as can imagine but the whole game is getting from set point A to set point B on a given path while mashing buttons together when coming across enemies. Dodging works great with the right stick but it's under utilized, you don't get into any cars, bikes, or mechanisms unless it's a cut scene. I am not sure why people are complaining about,This is game is fun, nice cartoonish graphics,It can be very addictive, and it's a new idea,I usually play FPS games,I bought this game for my kids,Now we take turns playing it on different saves,And watching each other play,The story is a simple one,And is meant for younger audiences,We have not played the multiplayer version yet,Because we don't have a second controller,Maybe Black Friday will slash accessory prices a bit,This game is no BF4, COD, or AC,And its not meant to be,But I am giving this game a solid 5,Because its fun and everyone is having fun,And that's what's important,If you're not!Then I recommend trading the game in for something else,While the prices are still high,But in my opinion it's a great family game,That gathers everyone together,To have some fun,", "qas": [{"id": 94, "question": "I\u00b4ve got two kids.

{"context": "Graphics, story was good. Gameplay was surprisingly challenging, evoking classic game play of yore where current gen. games today inundate you with tips, suggestions to calibrate the difficulty down, this game will require that you actually pay attention, at least a little bit. This game feels like a playable movie with the best graphics during gameplay of any game I have ever seen. It's starts a little slow like a movie and you have to go through the training but like many movies I have watched it keeps getting better and better. My 9 year old son has played it the most and he is addicted to the gameplay. I can watch a movie if I want great graphics but this is a game that matches up to some of the best CGI movies out there. I can't stop watching my son play the game because it is so enjoyable and each chapter is new and different. My son received the PS4 for Christmas. This is his first gaming console. I purchased KNACK for him because it was rated E. He loved the game. He felt so confident playing the game. He completed the game in the 2nd week. I probably would not recommend this game for experienced gamers but it was exactly what my son needed to boost his confidence. I recommend this game for kids. I never found myself bored and I thoroughly enjoyed the story. Looking at going back to play the game again to find all the parts. Graphically it's not in your face amazing, but the lighting is fantastic and while some levels are more plain than others this is a really clean looking game -- and in Knack's case that's a good thing. Youtube and other sites don't do it justice with the compression artifacts. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves old-school action platformers and like the animated family feature look.If it's an epic game you are looking for however, Knack is probably not for you. It turns out that Knack can pick up wood, metal, ice, and some other kind of dark onyx looking material. Each have a certain purpose in the game (not necessarily all are good purposes).There are tons of collectibles including special relics (aqua, emerald, ruby, platinum, etc) and parts for the Dr's inventions. Once all of one particular type of relic are collected, this unlocks a knew version of Knack (Vampire, Brittle, Massive, etc). Once all parts are collected for an invention, you are able to equip that invention as an upgrade.", "qas": [{"id": 95, "question": "I have a PS4 and looking for games for my 5 year old son.

{"context": "I loved Knack it was a very good game for a PlayStation 4 start-up I would buy it I got my copy on amazon for only 37$ instead of 60! Fun story outstanding game-play you would enjoy it although the rating is E10 the game does have some parts in the story that will make you think &#34;Wow this is not E10 its more like T&#34; The cover of the game catches you off guard thinking that it is a kids game its really not there are 13 chapters that you have to beat and each chapter has about 5 missions so the game gives you a lot of time after you beat the game you still have many extras to do like the mini-games or collect trophies. * Not worth new-release cost! * Knack game has no manual, and I can't figure out how to play 2 players. * Online manual just says \"Grab an extra DS4 controller and get a friend to lend a helping hand...\", nothing on how to actually join the game. * After googling and not finding the answer. I figured it out. One of the players HAS to be a PSN account that is logged in. * Knack requires 37 GB to install, yet still requires the disc to play. It's not Mario, Sonic, or Crash Bandicoot but it's great in it's own way. It's a nice break to jist be able to lay back and enjoy something for fun. It's still challenging but not to the point where I have to stay completely focused on not getting killed. I can sit back, relax, and really just enjoy myself. I thought I was just getting bored of video games cause they feel like a second job these days but this is just pure fun. I'm 20 and almost only got M rated games last gen and yet I'm having an amazing time with this. I've been playing this game during times im bored of AC4 on my PS4 or the almost endless library i have on steam for PC. If you enjoy platforming, in its the most basic form and old school in execution, you will enjoy this game. If you're expecting literally ANYTHING else, you will not enjoy this game. Its a fantastic looking, very very very fun throwback to the classic PS1 and PS2 platformers that made history. If you're spoiled by whats out there today and know nothing else, skip this. All in all, its been an awesome ride to me so far, but i absolutely enjoyed and loved every second of the likes of crash bandicoot, spyro, tomb raider, jak n daxter, ratchet n clank etc. Gameplay is smooth and the controls are very easy to get use to. The story was almost like watching a Pixar film and I felt like it drew me in even though I'm a 25 year old male. The game does prove challenging but I think the developers did a great job with the dynamics between Knack's size changing through the levels and how you can use special power abilities to get through difficult situations that may throw a lot of enemies your way.All in all, I'm very satisfied with purchasing Knack.

{"context": "Decided to try Knack out despite the mixed reviews from gaming sites. I actually had a lot of fun with it but it does have some downsides to it.What it has going for it:-Knack is a very family friendly game to play around your kids, there is no language and the story is easily understood by younger players/viewers.-Despite being family friendly it does have a fairly interesting story (albeit a bit cut and dry).-Controlling Knack in his smaller forms during battle is fun and engaging (especially in easy mode)-Easy mode still presents a challenge at timesMy biggest draw backs to the game:-Normal mode felt very difficult and stressful. There is some slow down when Knack is at his largest size. I *think* it's slowdown anyways. Like when Knack gets killed and all the relics spill out slowly. It may be that the devs intended to produce a &#34;slow motion&#34; effect. I think it's more likely the hundreds of thousands of parts bogging down the system. Also, when Knack is moving at his largest size and fighting an enemy he seems much slower and unresponsive. Again, that may have been intentional so I&#34;m not sure.There is no foul language which I appreciate. My son loves to play it, that's as deep as my game analysis goes. The graphics are excellent, as they should be on a PS4. This game has received the highest recommendation of my boy who has told me that I should play it. As a dad, I'm happy to have a game that is entertaining, high quality, and doesn't have language/blood/sexual overtones. So, today was the day. The day I got my Playstation 4. UPS delivered it at like 5 something. I saw this game got varied reviews. But it looked so fun to me, so I decided that this would be the first game I played.The game is very simple. You run, jump, hit and evade. But it is one of the funniest games I have ever played. What does it mean then, when a game is so simple, but you get such a special feeling when playing? The first several hours I played of the game on launch day were a blast. By day two though, the formula of &#34;turn a corner, fight a set of enemies, collect some shards, turn another corner, fight another set of enemies, collect some shards, wash rinse repeat etc.&#34; began to get a little stale and the game grew more and more monotonous. For the final stretch to beat the game however, Knack seemed to get fun again. For the bulk of the 10 or so hours I put into the game I had a good time, It was just those middle hours I guess where the game seemed to drag a bit.Should you buy Knack?", "qas": [{"id": 97, "question": "Good day, the game has the Spanish language.", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1392, "text": "As a dad, I'm happy to have a game that is entertaining, high quality, and doesn't have language/blood/sexual overtones."}, {"answer_start": 1936, "text": "The first several hours I played of the game on launch day were a blast."}, {"answer_start": 2359, "text": "For the bulk of the 10 or so hours I put into the game I had a good time, It was just those middle hours I guess where the game seemed to drag a bit.Should you buy Knack?"}, {"answer_start": 2009, "text": "By day two though, the formula of &#34;turn a corner, fight a set of enemies, collect some shards, turn another corner, fight another set of enemies, collect some shards, wash rinse repeat etc.&#34; began to get a little stale and the game grew more and more monotonous."}, {"answer_start": 1513, "text": "So, today was the day."}]}]}
{"context": "I'm very upset with the way this game was marketed as a 2 (local) player game.This is one of very few non sports 2 player games. However, the moment player 2 starts in it's clear that 2 player mode was a complete afterthought and probably just a marketing gimmick to sell more.It isn't 2 player mode, it's one player mode and a second player can jump in. The second player doesn't have half of knacks powers, he's not involved in any cut scenes, his being there alters the game in no way whatsoever (other than making it easier), and if he doesn't stay close to the first player, he automatically dies.Normally with a shared screen, it will zoom out if the players get too far away, not on Knack.The second (less important player) gets a 10 second warning, or just dies immediately sometimes.It's okay if someone is trying to play along for 5-10 minutes and be on their way, but if you're looking for a game to play and beat with your friend/roomate/brother/girlfriend, etc. Me and my little guy love playing this. Easy and free flowing. Second player could be more involved but overall not a game killer. My kid loves this game so it doesn't matter what other reviewers say. Get this as a kid friendly fun game. Make no mistake-Knack is a very different type of game. It's essentially two parts brawler, one part lite strategy. I was pretty keen on the game myself but I could definitely see how it would not be everyone's cup of tea. Of the three PS4 games I bought at launch though, Knack was the one I kept finding myself drawn back to. Without going into a lot of explanation I will just say that it was &#34;fun&#34; and I kept wanting to play it even after I had dabbled in the graphically superior Killzone and Assasin's Creed games.Knack's biggest fault lies in its repetitive game play. Knack is an exclusive launch title for the PS4 from SCE Japan Studio, the studio who developed such series as Demon's Souls, Ape Escape, LocoRoco, and Patapon. Knack enlists a charming cast of cartoony characters, of which the most notable is Knack, who is developed to save humanity from the Goblins. Players will battle through a linear, easy to follow campaign and collect a variety of collectibles while solving puzzles and smashing goblins and robots. While comedic in appearance, Knack will provide a challenging experience for all skill levels and ages, and has quite the learning curve as players will quickly find themselves repeating areas over and over to master their strategy. The characters themselves have near Pixar styled models and the colors show themselves nicely. It is not a \"realistic\" style in the vein of Battlefield or Killzone, but it is gorgeous in its own right. Also, so far there have been no noticeable framerate issues or tearing.The combat is is a throwback to old school platformers where strategy is needed to fully succeed instead of simple button mashing. When I confront enemies, I simply can't punch erratically or I'm going to die...a lot. Instead, each enemy has a timing to them...some shooting arrows, some swinging weapons while others use shields or tanks.", "qas": [{"id": 98, "question": "What type of game is this?

{"context": "I was initially disappointed that the middle touch button and triggers had no functionality but you can do so much with the 3 button scheme that I mentioned, that in the end, its not a big deal.Graphics? I love the graphics. It certainly is next gen. Cartoony games kinda get a pass on the graphics department. Certainly, when Watch Dogs comes out, it will be awesome on the visual department. But a cartoon game is a cartoon game and this is the best looking cartoon game out there. Better than Skylanders.Storyline and voice acting? the whole hitting O and then one of the other buttons to unleash a super power? Seems kind of awkward! It would be better suited as a PC game in my opinion, but while it is awkward, it's not impossible. It just takes awhile to get used to.The graphics are great! The amount of action that can be happening on screen, without showing any signs of slowing is just amazing! True, the graphics lack any realism, but it was never intended to look realistic. It has a cartoon look that reminds me quite a bit of World of Warcraft. Cooperative game play is possible, but the co-op play is an area where the professional reviewers probably have a good point in saying it isn't as fun or useful to play through that way (for at least one of the players).The artwork is nicely done, though the graphics are very cartoonish (intentionally so), rather than realistic. It seems that some reviewers knock the game because it wasn't as graphically impressive as some might have expected from a next generation system. I'm not sure what those reviewers expected to find, but I think the graphics are very well done and fit very well for the style that it seems the developers were looking for. If you like Ratchet & Clank, this is right up your alley.Knack is an ancient artifact/relic with a brain. As you play and collect more relics, he grows from dog size to godzilla size. When you get hit, he loses them and shrinks.The graphics look like a pixar movie. All his combined pieces show off the PS4 hardware with great lighting and shadow effects.Lots of level types.

{"context": "I guess I know how General Zod and Superman felt prior to training their senses in Man of Steel. Eventually, I got the knack for scanning and found it very effective for finding nearby assets. The other controls: running, shooting, crouching and looking around, are the usual fare if you've ever played an open world game. I have no complaints with controls other than driving. The tutorial system is pretty straightforward and sticks around long enough for you to get accustomed to the controls. Most menus are easily accessed with one button and sub-menus are navigated with the analog sticks. Well, it's common knowledge that the PS4 is lacking a bit in the game department. There aren't too many great games to choose from. Watch Dogs is a nice addition though.Watch Dogs is a pretty good game. It's not amazing but it's good. I plan on playing it all the way through. I put some time into it last weekend. It's a Grand Theft Auto kind of game but still different so don't expect the same thing. This is less focused on violence but violence is still there. If you're looking for a PS4 GTA then this should hold you over until it gets made. At least the brutal physical violence isn't there (as long as you don't include guns) You can't just walk down the street and kick a person to death. NO you gotta shoot em :) Aiden Pearce's first move, then, is instantly to threaten that character's family members without ever caring that that was the very kind of action that had driven him to action in the first place.The other characters are reduced to worn out stereotypes and tropes, and the Ubisoft team was apparently not afraid to seem racist or sexist in their characters. I can only count one female character who isn't brutalized by violence, and she is in the game for maybe 60 seconds. She's supposed to be a psychiatrist, but she's used only as a babysitter. So basically all my son and I can do together is create a private session, and go shoot people and see how many cop cars we can stack up. THAT'S IT !?!?! There should be an entire set of side missions or objectives for multiplayer. maybe in the future.Also adult content is on par with GTA.

{"context": "It's a leap into the 21st century for open-world games. I spent about six hours with this game so far, and I have to say, I am hooked. I work in IT, so the fact that this game is built around hacking was something I found interesting. Everyone and everything connecting to ctOS is a potential target, even city infrastructure! Manipulating city infrastructure already came in handy for me on several occasions. If only it were that easy, though. Anyway, I love open-world games. Rather than it being a challenge, you're doing it just to do it. A lot of people have become lazy nowadays in that they play games just to play them, and not actually work for the end. Remember when we were little, and we had to play that one level over and over and over again to beat it, and once we did it was the greatest feeling in the world? That's kind of how driving feels to me. Yeah it's hard, but I don't think it was meant to be easy. Overall good gameplay.This game did have some holes and weak points, but one comparison for Watch Dogs would be the first Assassin's Creed game. The first Assassin's Creed game got mixed reviews but many said showed promise, which would need to be polished up. And Assassin's Creed ended up becoming a very popular franchise as the games did improve. That's somewhat the case for Watch Dogs -- a great game that has various faults, but it does show promise to be improved upon for sequels to come.I'd give this game a &#34;4.25&#34;, but unfortunately Amazon does not allow this. If you play the game yourself, and you have any familiarity with some good western movies, you will notice that Ubis main character Aiden is very specific to what they wanted, and it's all meant to be disarming and go down easy, similar to the western movie approach - you don't panic when john wayne, charles bronson, or clint eastwood, cowboy-clad, guns somebody down, and for the same reason, you won't panic playing aiden pierce and accidentally hitting a pedestrian while driving. It's all very realistic, but still theatrical. It's far too easy to kill someone than spare them, and ultimately I don't really have a reason to care how I act. Again, compared to Infamous, my choices felt more impactful. Killing a civilian meant the breaking of a multiplier streak or gaining a super ability in Infamous: Second Son. In Watch Dogs, it just feels like an unimportant part of the game.Another weak aspect of the game is also the side missions. Now, there is a lot of content to do on the side. There are mini-games that can be played, exploration tasks, and online missions (more on this later).", "qas": [{"id": 102, "question": "I'm curious if Watch Dogs is meant to be 21st Century Assassin's Creed?

{"context": "I have an understanding why they wouldn't want to release this game shortly after GTA, the graphics are nice and they gameplay is smooth. I like the bonus games within the environment. My only complaint is the game seems to loose its appeal after a straight hour of play. It seems like your doing the same thing over and over.My favorite game of all time is Skyrim, even though I didn't think I would like it I was amazed at the vast open world and options to construct your own adventure. I expected this game to be similar as far as how you go about the story. It shows initial promise, but the more one plays, the more one begins to feel like they are playing the same game they were six years ago when &#34;Grand Theft Auto IV&#34; hit the scene, albeit stripped of some integral features and with some neat twists thrown on top of it. This is not a revolutionary game by any stretch of the imagination, and reminds me of a time when the market was positively flooded with games attempting to ape Rockstar's success. The problem, then, is that several other open-world games have come along since then and improved the formula in drastic ways, making this game's fight an uphill battle as it tries and only partially succeeds to distinguish itself from the rest of the pack.The story doesn't do this struggle for identity any favors, as it is one of the most by-the-numbers and generic plots out there. Watch Dawgs, aka Loading Dogs, plays as cinematic gaming experience... except for the awkward initial install (PSN DL). They start you out in a loadium where it's the bottom of the eighth. You've found the shooter and click. \"Damn it. Gimme my bullets Jordi.\" \"Can't. Threw them away.\" Run! Run! You're hackin', you're shootin' stuff! Then blam. Loading~86% (sunuvagun shoots right up like an iPhone battery then takes forever to finish). Leave your PS4 running... you've been warned.But back to the cinema, the opening's beautiful. \"I really think someone had a big \"open world\" check list and decided to add everything in. Racing...check! Go shoot that guy...check! Follow this guy around without being seen...check! Go buy some guns and clothes you don't need...check!Watch Dogs does not do enough to separate itself from the pack. The hacking is okay but most of the time you are just hitting the same button over and over again. The info you get from hacking gives life to the world but it's not enough to flush out the game.One thing that might make or break this game for you are the stealth missions. Also running around with your cell phone out and on, hacking bank account at will seems like a poor design. Why isn't there a battery life forcing you to stop hacking people or have some sort of Cool Down period like when you hack a bridge or traffic light. Makes the need for money useless. I'm only 10% complete with the story line and I'm well over $2,000,000 in my bank with every gun unlocked / purchased.

I buy this, with 1 day shipping, and it gets here today, and there are no dogs in the box, just some DVD, and the DVD ain't worth nothing, I put it in T-Bone's DVD player and it won't play. We can't even watch the movie. So now I got a boring weekend with some weird movie I can't watch, and no weed, and no guard dogs for the crib. Who wants a charming healthy nathan drake persona when you can have a dry, shows-little-emotion tough blue collar personality? And specifically with this main character, it is clear to me (even though i'm far from finishing the game) that Ubi designed Aiden Pierce to be urban-cowboy-esque. The most obvious giveaway is that his default costume is a cowboy duster. He wears a hat like a cowboy, but the city version of a cowboy hat - the hat is cheap and gimmicky beyond the shady &#34;hiding&#34; vibe, so I decided they chose this to be his urban cowboy hat. I will probably update this review if I have time to do so, as I progress through this game. I was really stressed out from work and studying this weekend, I started the download last night, went to bed, then work in the am.

{"context": "You hack cameras and spot enemies before they spot you. Wow, right? Sounds innovative! No, it's dumb, not innovative. Scenario time. Let's say I'm in a mission, a fenced enemy base. There are 20 enemies inside, cameras everywhere in the building. Cool. I jump the fence, hack the cameras, identify the enemies. Now I am expected to pick them off one by one, all 20 of them. Hack their gadgets, make their bombs go off, hack electrical panels, basically do anything that can stealthily kill them. Maybe on the hardest setting, but definitly &#34;not&#34; on normal. The story is ok-ish, though far away from the quality or depths of e.g. Last of Us or Uncharted, rather up close to AC IV - and for sure far away from GTA V, which is the obivous game to compare it to.None the less, it's the city and the details (background information, voice overs,...) of its citizens that suck you in, it happened to me more than once that I just walked through the streets enjoying the scenery.However, there are few things wrong with Watchpuppies that keep nagging me.- All cars have the same horn,the company producing these must have a monopole.They probably own the company that build ctOS.- Honking a horn always has the same sound,whether you are inside a tunnel, within narrowstreets or out in the fields.Even when you ride a motorcycle.- Car engines sound flat.- Driving feels boring. Yes, f-ing trash scanning. As some of you may know, (public) trash is considered \"open property,\" meaning it has no 4th Amendment protections. So, in Watch Dawgs they installed cameras inside the trash cans to scan for drug/cash/etc. drop offs/exchanges. Some guy dropped a sack of drugs in the trash can, they scanned it, and blam, drug deal busted. How's that for a mind blowing concept?Here another mind blowing concept: plant pattern scanning.

When it comes to the driving, Watch Dogs cannot be blamed for attempting to make the driving as realistic as possible. I for one like it, but many people have complained that the driving is extremely difficult but then maybe they should just drive the cars with good handling. You can't shoot put of your car, which was kind of a bummer, but hopefully that will be a feature in Watch Dogs 2. Gun wise they have a large selection of real guns that you can find or but at a local gun shop. Ubisoft really hit their mark with this game, sure it wasn't up to all the hype but it was way up there. The whole idea of hacking is really cool, listening to people's phone calls and text messages adds a really cool immersion effect. Hacking cameras and spying on people is really fun, especially when it add the tactical advantage to some missions. Activating a grenade on an enemy and watching them panic attempting to throw it, only to toss it and kill more people. Sure the driving does feel weird but the rest of the game makes up for it. After its initial reveal I admit I was hyped, the thought of a modern day Assassin's Creed with next gen graphics was something that was hard to pass up. I wasn't too hung up about graphics downgrades, since it's still very early into the PS4 generation. I was concerned about all the of the ridiculous preorder editions and the real lack of compelling story in the preview trailers, but I was ready for a Next Gen open world game so I kept my preorder despite reservations.The experience so far, about 20+ hours in, has been pretty mediocre. If I push the trigger button it should fire the gun, just saying. Also, shooting while driving, no go.Now the game is still a fun game. Most of the missions are pretty unique. Most of the side missions are awesome to pass the time. It can get challenging but it's a good challenging. You won't get bored. You might get aggravated but not bored. It does have replay value.

{"context": "The game can be fun at times but the story just feels rushed and buggy. The story particularly is emotionally draining and nor does it draw the player into its story as well as many other games like Grand theft Auto V. So, lacking this depth, it would have to make up for it in fun-factor/free roam. But unfortunately the free roam sucks. The car driving mechanics are laggy and feel tacked on just for the heck of it, and hacking is just a simple one button press no diversity to it at all.I hadn't really bought in to the hype .of this game. Absolutely incredible. I thought it was awesome. :D**Update 5/28**After spending some more time with the game last night, there were a few more things that I liked and didn't like. First off, I tried more multiplayer, and of the times that it worked I had a blast. I hacked a few people, and although it usually takes a while to get into someone else's game, once you do it's fun. I tried the multiplayer free roam, and although it has potential, it gets boring fast. (the sound itself, not the actual screaming).Online:I have not delved too deep into the multiplayer, but it is active as you play the game in single-player (you can disable it if you choose). Basically, the main features of multiplayer includes online hacking, tailing, decryption, racing, and free roam. The game introduces some of the online features to you in the game with bots, but when it comes to real people playing against you, all I can say is good luck. I have seen where people are saying it&#8217;s a combination of Grand Theft Auto and Assassins Creed. I can see why this comparison is made, but this game is much BETTER than both for a few reasons. The first reason is that it is not a sequel series.I am a firm believer that game sequels have a tendency to go stale unless they are online multiplayer formats. The whole hacking genre of this game is pretty sick. Like I said, it took a few missions to really get into it, but I am getting addicted to it quickly.The free roam capability that is comparable to GTA is much more advanced. Story was alright but rather easy.Online sucks, extremely laggy. Not much to do. Can't kill other people in free roam so no point in it.A lot of noobs that disconnect there internet when your about to hack them so you don't get pointsCan't team with your friends, you get stuck playing with people that suck that just ruin the game.point system sucks not very balanced.level maxes out at 50. which you will reach extremely fast.", "qas": [{"id": 108, "question": "How do you get on the multiplayer free roam where there are other players?

{"context": "So, here are the pros and cons I've found about the game. Just know, you need to have a computer with fairly good specs and a Uplay account (which are free to make).PROS-The shipping was very fast, and came only a few days after I ordered it-The game runs smoothly as long as your computer has a good graphics card and a good amount of RAM, it runs nice if I put my 6gb RAM Windows 8 computer on high performance while playing-Very fun!!! As a first time AC player, I found the storyline interesting and engaging. The first battle (sea battle) was fun. After that (less than 30 minutes of play time), it hasn't been very interesting. Dude will climb anything he comes near whether I want him to or not. Poor controls. Poor POV. Long boring sequences of following people. Poor tutorial. Just not nearly as fun as every other PC game I've played over the last 10 years or so.I'll try a few more times and change the rating if I come around to liking it, but so far it has been a disappointment. I decided to purchase the PC version with great reluctance as I hated Assasins creed 3. But after reading the reviews and the deal I got from Amazon I decided to give it a shot. I was am running windows 7 and was glad that the game started without having to update everything. But the sound was delayed and it ran so slow it was aggravating. Tried various fixes nothing worked. After the first quest the black flag intro came up and more settings became unlocked after changing the screen resolution from Max to the middle option all the issue's were resolved and the screen stayed as crisp as ever. I bought it for my son the gamer, and it would'nt play on his brand new $8,000 gaming laptop. Heard lots of other complaints from dissapointed gamers over Christmas. It really is open world, and there is a ton of stuff to do. The side missions aren't monotonous like in the previous games, and you lose a ton of time just doing everything there is to do.

Another Monday...another long boring agenda call with everyone pointing fingers and screaming why did it not get done. Well now its 8 o clock and somebody has to pay. Have I ever gotten that little bit of extra credit for completing the mission without fighting? NO....CAUSE THEY ARE ALL GOING DOWN!I have not played them all but is the best game I have played in years. Will my kids ever see it...definatley not but there is a time and place for everything and if you need to pop the cork on your stress bottle then buy this game. My computer is actually really good for gaming (I do a lot of graphics work, so it has to) and I've heard so many complaints that I know it's not my fault.But I'm sure these are all things you've heard before. Besides the fact that Ubisoft seems to have a personal grudge against PC players, Black Flag is actually a very wonderful and engaging game, I absolutely love it.

{"context": "for those of you with a powerful computer like mine that can play max settings this game is for you. it has been a long time since i feel that i am buying a game for my pc rather than a xbox 360 game for my pc. by that i mean the graphics and visuals in this game is far more superior and better than any other assassin creed game. its more bigger and better. the game is what assassin creed series needed.and frankly for the past few games i honestly thought that it was just the same car with a different paint job.and they were definitely not as lazy (or rushed as i suspect) then the last few games i had honestly thought that assassin creed series was a dead title after the last two games. It really is open world, and there is a ton of stuff to do. The side missions aren't monotonous like in the previous games, and you lose a ton of time just doing everything there is to do.

I'm sure the game is fine, but the seller is not. I am incredibly aggravated and I want my money back! Couldn't install the game from the DVD. I had to download and install the slow Uplay to download then install the game. When installing the game gets hung up early on a kinston.forge file. Tried everything to get it past that point. Not steam compatible so that is the biggest downer. Would have rather spend the hours playing the game instead of trying to figure out why it won't install. The game itself is fantastic! The game play itself is great, there are plenty of things to do spread over a large game world. The trouble for the PC version of this game is in stability and optimization. For me the only way I can even play the game is to turn off Ubisoft's Uplay platform's in game overlay(if you don't know what I am talking about it is like Steam, Origin, and dozens of other programs through which you can launch game. AC4: Black Flag also has optimization problems, the biggest of which is how it handles frames per second. I own most of the Assassin's Creed games on Steam. They are great games, don't get me wrong but this iteration is once again plagued by the horrendous free-running control as AC3 had. Your character often takes your suggestion to hang off a wall by fingertips and sneak along it as an order to jump up on top of the wall for all the enemy to see. Then when you try to correct this wayward behavior he over-compensates by dropping completely off the wall (usually into a pack of guards below that you were trying to get by) instead of hanging from it again. ordered cd version because internet service in my area is at best terrible.. hughesnet satellite.... installed cd's onto computer and game wouldn't launch... said inproper installation and to try reinstalling.. uninstalled and tried to reinstall..game would not reinstall from cd's.. had to download from uplay.. after trying to download for 2 weeks, e-mailed uplay ( no way to call them) asking if they could wipe my account, so i could reinstall from cd's.. answer a week later (great cust service ha-ha) answer was negitive... after another week of trying to reinstall, i finally managed to get 85% of game downloaded when uplay account did some kind of update and wipe out my progress... i'm now back at square 1, looking at another 3-4 weeks of trying to download this game.", "qas": [{"id": 114, "question": "is this a steam activation code or uplay?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 878, "text": "For me the only way I can even play the game is to turn off Ubisoft's Uplay platform's in game overlay(if you don't know what I am talking about it is like Steam, Origin, and dozens of other programs through which you can launch game."}, {"answer_start": 517, "text": "Not steam compatible so that is the biggest downer."}, {"answer_start": 1219, "text": "I own most of the Assassin's Creed games on Steam."}, {"answer_start": 324, "text": "I had to download and install the slow Uplay to download then install the game."}, {"answer_start": 36, "text": "When I put in the code for the game, it had said that the code was already used."}]}]}

One of the things that always made AC games so cool and interesting is the mystery factor to it. That seems to be missing significantly. * Like AC3, the music in AC4 is terrible. AC2 and ACBrotherhood had wonderful music that helped to make both games magical. AC3 and AC4 have sorely lacked it, and it is incredibly noticeable; for the worse. * One of the things that made Ezio's trilogy so special as well, is the fact that they stuck with the same hero for a bit. They went through all of his introduction and training to become a master fighter and assassin in AC2, and continued it in ACB /ACR -- this gave us plenty of time to get used to our hero, and become attached to him.

{"context": "8 assassins killing batman? That's obviously a seller, but when it doesn't promise on what it delivers, it's quite disappointing. I'm not gonna make this long.Big Lack of Innovation! Comparing this to Arkham city, the city was alive. Thugs with guns, knifes, and having conversations with each other. Origins barely have free roaming worth exploring. You would only find small side quests or easy enemies. Combat system is still great, but moves look so similar to Arkham city. Stealth is decent as to the mission being a little more interesting. I never write reviews for anything but I had to chime in on this game. Like a lot of people, I am a huge fan of the games that were made by Rocksteady so I was eager to play this one. Very quickly my eagerness turned to unhappiness after I stated playing. After playing for a couple hours, I experienced numerous freezes and at one point had to shut my console off while the game saved so my file was corrupted and had to start all over (my frustration begins). The second time around, I experienced a lot of lag and frozen screens again causing me to rest my Xbox but no issues with saving yet (and then)... Iim on the firefly mission and the game glitches out and I start free falling down until I die. This is Batman in his 2nd year, so he is still on bad terms with the police but does have Alfred to talk to for help and a full Batcave to train in. Having wrapped up the main campaign, I think it's overall a improvement on what we got from Arkham City in terms of game design. There were plenty of fun little twists and cameos that will make any Batman fan happy to see. I really liked that you had pretty much free reign to run around and tackle challenges as you please, and just stop what you're doing and tackle an ongoing crime if you wanted to. The same gadgets&#8230; And then are the bugs. I heard a lot about crashing and freezing &#8211; and it happened to me too &#8211; but the most annoying thing I got was the fight bugs. You probably know that after a certain number of hits, you entered into &#8220;Free Focus&#8221; mode, where everything gets slower around you and you can increase your combo. It worked perfectly in both Asylum and City. The problem in Origins is that the &#8220;Slow mode&#8221; seems to be only into a limited space around Batman. The original Arkham games did not need to check any boxes, and were therefore free to tell the story that they wanted to. This game, however, stutters a little when it has to take time out of the game's story in order to tell some of 'Batman's story'. However, that said, the story is quite strong. There are a few good twists (nothing of the level of games like Bioshock Infinite), but things that make the game more involved than simply fighting off a couple of assassins that have come to kill you (once again, not a spoiler - this is on the back of the game box).Graphics- I'm not a graphics snob, but there are times when the graphics look great, and other times when they don't.", "qas": [{"id": 118, "question": "Is it free roam?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 301, "text": "Origins barely have free roaming worth exploring."}, {"answer_start": 2322, "text": "The original Arkham games did not need to check any boxes, and were therefore free to tell the story that they wanted to."}, {"answer_start": 1624, "text": "I really liked that you had pretty much free reign to run around and tackle challenges as you please, and just stop what you're doing and tackle an ongoing crime if you wanted to."}, {"answer_start": 1989, "text": "You probably know that after a certain number of hits, you entered into &#8220;Free Focus&#8221; mode, where everything gets slower around you and you can increase your combo."}, {"answer_start": 1009, "text": "The second time around, I experienced a lot of lag and frozen screens again causing me to rest my Xbox but no issues with saving yet (and then)...

{"context": "I could sit here, and compare Origins to Asylum, and City all day, but I won't. Origins is a really fantastic game that's on par with the other two (although made by a different studio.) I'm an avid Batman fan, and I have to say I was completely taken away by this game. After hearing so many &#34;ifs&#34; and &#34;buts&#34; about it previously, I can honestly say I was skeptical. Then I decided to get my copy, and I absolutely loved it. Ever since Arkham Asylum my older 2 boys have clamored for every Batman Arkham game and all the gameplay and mechanics hold true and are even enhanced in this installment. Of course the graphics of games just keep getting better and as a dad I just sit and watch these like interactive movies. Very immersive. Being a Batman fan I love seeing all these takes on the rogues gallery of villians especially Deathstroke and Firefly sorry for spoilers but its been 6 months so deal with it. Some have complained its more of the same gameplay but so are a lot of games and at least the characters and story here are solid. There are some problems with this game, a few bugs here and there that don't kill the gameplay, it does hinder it. I got to the point where i was not sure what to do, and just let it sit on the shelf. I haven't played it in a few months, but if you can get it on the cheap, then it's worth at least a weekend play. My boys sit for hours playing the game. They are constantly trying to outdo each other. Fits well with the other batman games. Only negatives to multi-player: Few maps, one game mode, MUST have eight players to even start a match, and the capture points don't really do anything except give you XP.If you love this series, wait for a price drop. It may have much to offer, but it's just not as appealing as Rocksteady's games.

{"context": "Which is fine, but when playing it, why does it feel like an extension of the last game? You make your way around Gotham beating up criminals which gets monotonous and trying to deactivate towers so fast travel can be unlocked and it's so sloppily done. Oh yeah, and you are supposed to stop Black Mask and you spend so much time just trying to get through the 1st hour of the game you may forget that this is your main task. Then to further exasperate matters is that I wound up with 2 defective disks. Literally as soon as I turn the game on to play it, it tells me that I have corrupted downloadable content, and boots me back to the home screen. I haven't downloaded a thing, I literally just opened this game! I can't believe I wasted money on a disk that isn't even recognized as a disk half the time in my xbox. Thanks for ruining my Christmas. So if you loved the first two games as much as I did, you're going to be thrilled with this installment, plain and simple. Another cool addition is the ability to access the challenge maps from the main menu or from inside the single player campaign within the Bat Cave. A nice touch.MULTIPLAYER! I actually hadn't heard there was going to be any multiplayer in this game, so that was a nice surprise when I put the disk in. However, it wasn't quite what I was hoping for. I realize that having a multiplayer on the challenge maps would be quite difficult to implement because of the freeflow combat, but I would really like to see them try to get that off the ground at some point. Some of the characters could have used some better talent, but overall the voices fit the characters.THE MULTIPLAYER: If it is broke...I spent twenty minutes tweaking and crafting my Joker goon and Bane Elite Guard.I spent another ten waiting to find a match.That was ten minutes I'd have rather spent in Gotham as Batman.Thankfully, multiplayer is on a second disk and was created by an entirely different studio. Why is this good? It means WB Montreal didn't sacrifice any resources on the multiplayer. After finishing the campaign, I thought to myself of why I wanted this game. It featured a new villain, The Riddler was in it, multi-player I was skeptical of, and it's a series that I love.

{"context": "Back to 5 stars now since the game is running as it should be. Thanks for following my journey through the updates. Please excuse me while I go play now :)**UPDATE 3/20/14**Just wanted to give you guys a heads up that I already pre-ordered Arkham Knight and will be reviewing that for Xbox One shortly after it comes out. I will provide a link if everything works out or look for it under that title when it comes out. Thanks for following. My very finicky son who has very discerning tastes when it comes to his video games has not played another game since I got this one. He is totally fascinated with its depth and scope. And as a parent, I see it helping with his ability to employ logic to lead to a successful conclusion. Even casual gamers should know that when a new game comes out especially high end ones like this invariably there will glitches that need to be fixed, this is why you should always wait a month or two before buying. That being said the game is terrific and a worthy addition to what is already a ground breaking series and by far the best comic book based games ever in my opinion. My son and I have had a blast so far playing it so if you have been thinking about not buying this one because of the initial negative buzz I hope this will help change your mind. This means that multiple times, an enemy comes from outside the screen (at normal speed) to you (still in slow motion) and blocks your combo. It started to happen at the middle of the game, and keeps on happening until the end of the game. This was a MAJOR annoyance.Other Gameplay problem (in a way), you can only play Batman. Arkham City was letting you play Catwoman freely, which was an awesome idea! Why can&#8217;t we play Robin here? This was a Christmas present for our grandson and he loves it.

{"context": "The game opens two years into Batman's career fighting crime in Gotham. Buildings broken in Arkham city are whole here in Arkham origins, exemplifying the eye for detail in the game and franchise as a whole. the story lines are engaging, the gadgets we are familiar with are back and there are some new toys to play with. The game play vis-a-vis controls is more challenging in this game, requiring patience and timing for combat to be successful. There are many boss fights and they can be challenging until you identify the enemy's weaknesses and batman's corresponding strengths. If you are anything like me, when you heard the next Batman: Arkham video game would be a prequel, you were excited, but unable to shake that sickly feeling in your stomach that comes with every &#34;...prequel.&#34;I'm happy to say, while Origins may not be the best of the series, it certainly belongs on the same shelf with the last two games.GAMEPLAY: If it's not broken...Origins takes the existing mechanics of Arkham City and transposes them into this new game. Aside from the fact that many of the thugs don't seem to know who he is, and the fact that the returning characters look and sound younger, you wouldn't know that this was a prequel. Frankly, the decision to make it a prequel at all is curious; it's obvious that the only reasons why they did it was to bring the Joker back, and justify not bringing back the same voice actors.Second, as I said above, the game itself really feels more like an expansion than a separate game. This is most obvious in the setting, which is basically the setting of Arkham City before it became a prison, plus an additional portion of Gotham across the bridge which is about half the size. i might not be getting this the first day it comes out, but this is something that everyone has to play. the first 2 batman arkham games were so great. don't forget they also got game of the year so this one might as well. the ability to play as slade or deathstroke is what im looking forward to. this might be a prequel, but it's gonna be a great prequel Let me preface my review by saying that I have never spent $60 on a game I didn't intend to like a whole lot, I loved Arkham Asylum & City, and I this was THE game I looked forward to playing all year.Arkham Origins was decent (albeit far more violent than its predecessors) until I ran into a glitch after losing to Copperhead.

{"context": "!now before i start picking it apart i'd like to say that i'm glad i bought it and am getting enjoyment from it for the most part, .....BUTi just can't begin to describe JUST how choppy the game plays!ESPECIALLY the hand to hand combat!! !i mean, that's the whole meat and potatoes of the game right there!! !though while not completely unplayable it's hit or miss, and i do mean that literally!! !this games big draw is the HUGE amount of Boss battles and when you face off in a very long drawn out battle where split decision precision timing means the difference between winning and having to restart a level all over again, it gets very VERY frustrating!! I'm biased I'll admit, because I'm a huge Batman fan.Let me get the good out of the way first:- It's way harder. The new enemy types, enemy numbers and the split second decisions on which to counter when means that maintaining a combo is harder than ever!- The boss battles are very unique, and rather satisfying in comparison to the previous two installments.- There's a lot more to do around Gotham, and it's a lot clearer what you're supposed to accomplishThe bad:- It's a little redundant. These side-missions allow you to truly feel like The Dark Knight protecting Gotham. However, I did find some of the crimes derivative (how many times can the same ATM be robbed? ), but overall, they are a step in the right direction.Plus, let's not forget Batman is The World's Greatest Detective. Occasionally, you'll hear the police sending detectives to a Crime Scene. These Crime Scenes setup mini-stories and allow for you to do some small investigations into what actually transpired, culminating in finding and subduing the perpetrator. I have to say I am unfortunately disappointed in WB Games Montreal and then work on this newest addition in the Batman franchise. So far I have only been able to play the game handful of times. I have attempted to play seven times. Of those seven times, four times the system would lock up I'm not even allow me to login. It would try to authenticate my WBID which you need to enter in order to get some of the free Batman skins. When it locks up like this you can't even get past the starting screen. I had to restart the game because a cutscene was suppose to appear when you get a certain boss' health bar down to 25%. The screen went black and never showed the cutscene(I waited for 5 minutes). After restarting the game(go to Xbox dashboard and enter the game again) and finishing the boss battle (again), the cutscene played.I also ran into a problem where Batman left the level. All of the enemies and the room I was in disappeared and all that was left was a gray environment with Batman in it(if you leap, you move further down the screen).", "qas": [{"id": 123, "question": "Does this game allow split screen mode?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2128, "text": "When it locks up like this you can't even get past the starting screen."}, {"answer_start": 1154, "text": "These side-missions allow you to truly feel like The Dark Knight protecting Gotham."}, {"answer_start": 2320, "text": "The screen went black and never showed the cutscene(I waited for 5 minutes)."}, {"answer_start": 1930, "text": "Of those seven times, four times the system would lock up I'm not even allow me to login."}, {"answer_start": 2584, "text": "All of the enemies and the room I was in disappeared and all that was left was a gray environment with Batman in it(if you leap, you move further down the screen)."}]}]}
{"context": "8 assassins killing batman? That's obviously a seller, but when it doesn't promise on what it delivers, it's quite disappointing. I'm not gonna make this long.Big Lack of Innovation! Comparing this to Arkham city, the city was alive. Thugs with guns, knifes, and having conversations with each other. Origins barely have free roaming worth exploring. You would only find small side quests or easy enemies. Combat system is still great, but moves look so similar to Arkham city. Stealth is decent as to the mission being a little more interesting. I never write reviews for anything but I had to chime in on this game. Like a lot of people, I am a huge fan of the games that were made by Rocksteady so I was eager to play this one. Very quickly my eagerness turned to unhappiness after I stated playing. After playing for a couple hours, I experienced numerous freezes and at one point had to shut my console off while the game saved so my file was corrupted and had to start all over (my frustration begins). The second time around, I experienced a lot of lag and frozen screens again causing me to rest my Xbox but no issues with saving yet (and then)... Iim on the firefly mission and the game glitches out and I start free falling down until I die. This is Batman in his 2nd year, so he is still on bad terms with the police but does have Alfred to talk to for help and a full Batcave to train in. Having wrapped up the main campaign, I think it's overall a improvement on what we got from Arkham City in terms of game design. There were plenty of fun little twists and cameos that will make any Batman fan happy to see. I really liked that you had pretty much free reign to run around and tackle challenges as you please, and just stop what you're doing and tackle an ongoing crime if you wanted to. The same gadgets&#8230; And then are the bugs. I heard a lot about crashing and freezing &#8211; and it happened to me too &#8211; but the most annoying thing I got was the fight bugs. You probably know that after a certain number of hits, you entered into &#8220;Free Focus&#8221; mode, where everything gets slower around you and you can increase your combo. It worked perfectly in both Asylum and City. The problem in Origins is that the &#8220;Slow mode&#8221; seems to be only into a limited space around Batman. The original Arkham games did not need to check any boxes, and were therefore free to tell the story that they wanted to. This game, however, stutters a little when it has to take time out of the game's story in order to tell some of 'Batman's story'. However, that said, the story is quite strong. There are a few good twists (nothing of the level of games like Bioshock Infinite), but things that make the game more involved than simply fighting off a couple of assassins that have come to kill you (once again, not a spoiler - this is on the back of the game box).Graphics- I'm not a graphics snob, but there are times when the graphics look great, and other times when they don't.", "qas": [{"id": 124, "question": "Is it free Roam?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 301, "text": "Origins barely have free roaming worth exploring."}, {"answer_start": 2322, "text": "The original Arkham games did not need to check any boxes, and were therefore free to tell the story that they wanted to."}, {"answer_start": 1624, "text": "I really liked that you had pretty much free reign to run around and tackle challenges as you please, and just stop what you're doing and tackle an ongoing crime if you wanted to."}, {"answer_start": 1989, "text": "You probably know that after a certain number of hits, you entered into &#8220;Free Focus&#8221; mode, where everything gets slower around you and you can increase your combo."}, {"answer_start": 1009, "text": "The second time around, I experienced a lot of lag and frozen screens again causing me to rest my Xbox but no issues with saving yet (and then)...

{"context": "Glad I got it on amazon, for the bonus content. The other places bonus content didn't really compete with amazons, but that's just an opinion :) It is riddled with bugs and when I almost beat it the first time it froze when my game was saving corrupting the file and forcing me to start the game all over again. I bought the season pass that was supposed to come loaded with content. So far, ONE downloadable content has worked and the rest are just missing. My inquiry to Warner Brothers went unanswered. They have my money... so they don't really seem to care if I get what I payed for.

{"context": "For example, you can't link Ibrahimovic with Cristiano Ronaldo and get full chemistry because they don't share a common league or nationality. Putting that aside, there are a number of nice new features in Ultimate Team this year. There are more leagues in the game than last year, including the Colombian league. The interface and player search feature have greatly been improved. Single online matches have returned after shockingly being left out last season, but now they can't end in a draw like they could in FIFA 12. If you are drawing after 90 minutes, you have to play extra time and go to penalties. Man, what a great game! The realistic action of the ball flying around the pitch is unprecedented. One of my favorite things is the mini-drills they have you run while your game is loading. They help your game get better.My only complaints are in the season mode, I can't load from the first screen. I have to take the back door in to my season my going through &#34;customize&#34;.

I've played FIFA 12 non stop for the past two years, debated whether the new game would be worth it, it is. They auto update the players of the teams, whether traded or whether their skill level adjusts. Team skill levels adjust as their actual skill level fluctuates during the real life season. Let me get straight to the point, Fifa 14 is by far the worst FIFA game I've played in the last 5 years! Unfortunately EA sports has not made any improvements to the game, but they have also ruined it by trying to make it more realistic(!). I'm not complaining because I can't win ,I just won my season one championship last week so I know how to play.

{"context": "In addition lob through passes have become way too overpowered. Legendary mode is less fun when most of the time you face an AI that barely makes mistakes, passes the ball with high accuracy, and gets awarded non existence penalty kicks!

If you don't know what Ultimate Team is, it's a game mode that allows you to collect and trade players in order to build your \"ultimate team.\" However, even though the game mode bills itself as Ultimate Team, there is a chemistry system in place that effectively prevents you from linking players in your lineup unless they play in the same league or have the same nationality. This really limits your creativity and prevents you from building your actual ultimate team. I want to like this game, but the EA Sports Servers are offline about half the time. This wouldn&#8217;t normally be a big deal for those not interested in playing online against other people, but in FIFA the Ultimate Team mode requires being connected to the EA Sports servers in order to play, even in single player mode.Bottom Line: It would be great, if EA could keep their servers online, or even be responsive about the problem. Well let me say that it's not the best ever FIFA, it has it's side of glitches and online play is laggy. But it's better than Pes that's for sure. Career mode is fun to me.

Overall it's not that bad. Oh and the soundtrack is okay. I liked FIFA 13's soundtrack better though. I love the youth academy and the career mode transfer market, as well as coaching a national team and all that, but Fifa 14 feels like its career mode took a step back from Fifa 13, which was still buggy (the worst being the -1 year contract remaining and a demand of a 5 year contract which made rising stars unobtainable free agents), but at least it was fun to play. Fifa 14's career mode on the other hand feels like work.

{"context": "Item received quickly. Bought for my son for Christmas. He has been wanting it forever. Played it at a friends house and said the graphics are great and fun to play. Bought this game on release day like I have every FIFA for the past few years and after a month or so I figured I would give an informed review of the game rather than a hasty bashing of the game like the people who complain because it isn't last year's game with updated rosters. The game play is something it takes time to adjust to, the dribbling and shooting are a lot more realistic. This means that you can't just sign the fastest guys to your squad and run past all of the defenders. It takes buildup and possession to score goals, you need to pick apart defenses from the midfield rather than just beat one defender and run down the wing or spray through balls through the central defenders. It has to be clearly mentioned that the game supports only NTSC boxes. mine is PAL therefore, it did not work and I can not do anything with it.I have lost 100USD cost+shipping on two games I bought together. If that's not bad enough, the controls don't work consistently. It almost seems like some of the code from last year is still in the game, and you never know when you should use the new controls and when to use last years'.I'm a FIFA fan, for better or worse, but when I want some good fifa action, I'll go back to FIFA 13 or the excellent FIFA10 WC:south Africa. I score 50% of my corner with my tall defender or attacker (Varane, Sakho, Falcao :-) ).Actually in most of my matches I score with the head on a crossing at least 50% of the goals. This is not balanced.Question: do I have to buy FIFA 13 if I already have Fifa 14: I do not think so. The price doesn't justify the pleasure of ball trajectory and because too easy to score with the head, tthe game is not as balanced as before.Conclusion: good game (which can still be improved) but wasted by unacceptable bugs :-(PS: I have never seen a crash with PES...", "qas": [{"id": 129, "question": "I ordered this item, and received the Central/South America version (with Messi, Vidal and Falcao on the cover).

{"context": "when you attempt to make a game realistic (in your own thoughts), you should consider the fact that it must not spoil the fun. As you can read in other reviews there are many many many issues that happen way too often in a game which makes you want to break your game. Just to mention a few:- super sluggish game-play and increased momentum of players- Easy cross and header goals that happen way too much in every game (Trust me, I also score most of my goals this way)- Dribbling with the best players in the world is almost impossible because of super late reactions and movements- Lofted through balls (which was so bad in the beginning that EA released a patch to fix it in the first few weeks)- Unrealistic first touch controls (sometimes players like Messi seem to have no idea how to stop an easy pass)- Ridiculously foolish team-mates (some things are totally out of your control...)- Forwards are in offside position 90% of the time (and don't seem to care at all! I much prefer to play against human players because there is more variety. It's also worth pointing out that many of the same AI flaws that have existed in the game for YEARS are still glaring. For example, defenders are absolutely horrible at making aerial challenges for the ball. So many times when a cross is whipped in, they will just stand flat-footed and let the attacker spike it right over them. In general, players lack awareness of the ball and aren't aggressive enough when it is near them. Many times the ball will squirt loose into space and your players will take steps away from it instead of trying to pounce like they would in real life. I have purchased many many FIFA games (dating back to 2002 World Cup Japan XBox -- sentimental favorite of mine to this day) -- this one is incredibly frustrating. After playing one World Cup campaign, I have a few gripes:(1) The Road to the World Cup feature is a pain, takes too long to simulate over training sessions and friendly's(2) if you simulate training sessions and friendly's (if you only want to play qualifiers), your players &#34;form&#34; is automatically dropped -- you'll see the down red arrows next to every player signifying drop in form or morale(3) player movement, most particularly on defense, it feels like the players are playing on ice -- forward or backward momentum carries them in circles, extremely tough to tackle opposing players with the ball. Game mechanic is a step forward but...You CANNOT play with your friends against other friends at all, in any of modes. It was never mentioned anywhere that Online Team Play will not be available and many players bought the game intending to play with friends (as they do not have time for seasons, ultimate team, career etc) like they used to in previous instances of Fifa.Not only it was not mentioned by EA but all the reviews, who gave the game 9/10 or 10/10 score did not mention Online Team Play gone. Bad move if it is the latter, as many of us won't upgrade to an Xbox one till Fifa 15 comes out.- The resolution on the game is higher and things look smaller on screen.I have to strain to see players on the pitch as the players appear smaller.Even the countdown timer in the Pause menu seems smaller.- Head-to-head online mode which I used all the time in Fifa 13 is kind of hidden away in a \"More\" menu- The game is too complicated with the Fifa build-your-team stuff etc.", "qas": [{"id": 130, "question": "how many players can play at a time?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2529, "text": "It was never mentioned anywhere that Online Team Play will not be available and many players bought the game intending to play with friends (as they do not have time for seasons, ultimate team, career etc) like they used to in previous instances of Fifa.Not only it was not mentioned by EA but all the reviews, who gave the game 9/10 or 10/10 score did not mention Online Team Play gone."}, {"answer_start": 2917, "text": "Bad move if it is the latter, as many of us won't upgrade to an Xbox one till Fifa 15 comes out.- The resolution on the game is higher and things look smaller on screen.I have to strain to see players on the pitch as the players appear smaller.Even the countdown timer in the Pause menu seems smaller.- Head-to-head online mode which I used all the time in Fifa 13 is kind of hidden away in a \"More\" menu- The game is too complicated with the Fifa build-your-team stuff etc."}, {"answer_start": 269, "text": "Just to mention a few:- super sluggish game-play and increased momentum of players- Easy cross and header goals that happen way too much in every game (Trust me, I also score most of my goals this way)- Dribbling with the best players in the world is almost impossible because of super late reactions and movements- Lofted through balls (which was so bad in the beginning that EA released a patch to fix it in the first few weeks)- Unrealistic first touch controls (sometimes players like Messi seem to have no idea how to stop an easy pass)- Ridiculously foolish team-mates (some things are totally out of your control...)- Forwards are in offside position 90% of the time (and don't seem to care at all!"}, {"answer_start": 975, "text": "I much prefer to play against human players because there is more variety."}, {"answer_start": 1478, "text": "Many times the ball will squirt loose into space and your players will take steps away from it instead of trying to pounce like they would in real life."}]}]}

Yet another avenue that you can follow in Skyrim if it suits your play style. Don't want to be one, no sweat. There's a cure. It took me hours to figure it out and get cured, but the entire process was fun!A House, a wife and a couple of kids?Skyrim lets you buy houses in the major towns, provided you've got the cash and have met the prerequisites for these purchases. Buying a house is pretty much a necessity if you plan to continue to explore dungeons and reap the fat loot rewards.

I definitely recommend this game (if you can handle the glitches) I have a lot to say about this game! I checked out reviews before I bought it, looked at the ratings people left for it and decided to get the legendary edition since it had the extra DLC included.

I also wanted to note that I used to play World of Warcraft years ago and the things I like about Skyrim are that it reminds me of WOW in that I get lost in the game but I like that I don't have to deal with other players and I can also play it without having to log in every day.-GraphicsWhen I first started playing the game, (I am not going to be giving away any spoilers) I was so distracted by how real the graphics looked that I almost missed part of the dialogue.

{"context": "One thing I do want to mention that might have made a difference is I turned off the autosave feature because I read that this causes problems. The only problem I have now is sometimes I will get killed and lose the last half hour of play time so I make sure to save whenever I enter a town or before a big fight.In conclusion, I could talk about this game forever as you have seen. I love it and have a lot of trouble with not wanting to play it all the time. I am 33 and have been playing games for over 20 years and haven't been so addicted to a game in a long time. The engine looks a lot better than Fallout3 or New Vegas. Yes, i understand that this game was created more recently, but still, there is an impressive difference in my opinion. The world of Skyrim is very colorful and very nice to look at. There is a lot of details in the different game world area you venture into. The menus are gorgeous and very pleasant to look at also which is a definite plus.SOUND - The music in this game is top notch. What else can be said here. Remember when Skyrim was $60? Did you hate that dawnguard and other dlc was priced at another $20 each? - If you answered yes to any of these, buy this game. All dlc included - even if the game is used. All bonuses included, and less than the original game in price. Bought used through amazon and it was like new condition for only $35. You cannot get more bang for your buck! This game has literally an infinite number of hours of entertainment. Every race, every style: mage, warrior, thief; it's brand new refreshing fun every time you play through the game. or you can go with the Dark Brotherhood (Assassins) if you're feeling particularly evil. Or are you the type of person that enjoys making a difference ? Join the Imperials or Stormcloaks and aid one side in the civil war. Or you can just run around doing petty jobs like farming or woodcutting or smithing. It's all your choice , you will not be bothered to do any of the quests as long as you don't want to . * There are so many things you can do here , I won't go into detail on all of it , Just buy the game ! Shock, on the other hand, drains your target's health and their magicka, so it's great to use it against mages. Finally, there's frost, which is just like slowing your enemies because they're frozen in place.Enchanting: Enchanting is a skill that can be used to to make your items stronger or have magical effects. But of course it's a pain trying to find the material you need to make enchanted items. In a typical moment of genius, Bethesda didn't put any limitations on Enchanting buffs, meaning you can do infinite loops with potions and equipment and end up with an iron dagger that could kill any boss quite easily.Illusion: This is just used for light since enemies can still detect you even if you're invisible.Restoration: Restoration is used for healing, curing disease, and fortifying your health, magic, and stamina.", "qas": [{"id": 138, "question": "Is there a difference between the game if I buy it new or i can just buy a used?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2016, "text": "* There are so many things you can do here , I won't go into detail on all of it , Just buy the game !"}, {"answer_start": 1310, "text": "Bought used through amazon and it was like new condition for only $35."}, {"answer_start": 1147, "text": "- If you answered yes to any of these, buy this game."}, {"answer_start": 0, "text": "One thing I do want to mention that might have made a difference is I turned off the autosave feature because I read that this causes problems."}, {"answer_start": 1201, "text": "All dlc included - even if the game is used."}]}]}
{"context": "I ordered Skyrim for my PS4... got the game, but it wasn't for the PS4, it was for the PS3.. I sent my complaint.. still haven't heard a reply in two weeks.. The only thing which prevents me from giving this game 5 stars is the fact that a questionable design in the way games are saved (the files are very large at 12mb for a level 40 character) results in decreasing game performance as the file size continues to increase. In fact, until I turned off the auto-save features for the game, the frame rate during play would drop dramatically as my PS3 struggled to write the save files. Once I turned off the auto saves, the game performed much better, but only up until around the 12 megabyte size for the save file, at which point the files seemed to become corrupted, and will no longer load.Overall, the actual game and game play are so great that by the time my character reaches level 40 and the save file becomes too large (and therefore the experience frustrating and less fun), I've had many hours of exciting game play. Seriously, hands down one of the best if not THE best. This game has everything and for the price includes all the DLC and add-ons saving you a fair amount of change. The game itself will provide you with hours upon hours of entertainment. Play as anything you like do anything you like, focus on the main story lines or ignore them, all up to you. And don't worry about multiple play throughs, with the numerous random events and random encounters each time you play its a different experience. I started to regret buying it and even thought about reselling it. Since I only played it for 10 hours, I decided to try it again with a fresh start. I made up a new character and started from the beginning. It was then I started to understand how to play the game and the game was becoming extrememly ADDICTIVE! I could not put it down. There were some days I played this for over 6 hours in one day. Even when my winter break was over, I could not put it down. I have never played RPG or any type of games like Skyrim. I only played Sims and shooting games, so I was reluctant to purchase this game. When my winter break was approaching, I saw this on sale as 30 dollars so I said &#34;what the heck I will try it&#34;. At first, I did not like it. I found this game too complicated, and being a indecisive person, having to make decisions every minute of the game drove me nuts. During the first gameplay (10 hours), I was becoming frustrated, so I put it down and did not play it for a month.", "qas": [{"id": 139, "question": "Will this play on a PS4?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "I ordered Skyrim for my PS4... got the game, but it wasn't for the PS4, it was for the PS3.."}, {"answer_start": 1270, "text": "Play as anything you like do anything you like, focus on the main story lines or ignore them, all up to you."}, {"answer_start": 1734, "text": "It was then I started to understand how to play the game and the game was becoming extrememly ADDICTIVE!"}, {"answer_start": 2408, "text": "During the first gameplay (10 hours), I was becoming frustrated, so I put it down and did not play it for a month."}, {"answer_start": 1379, "text": "And don't worry about multiple play throughs, with the numerous random events and random encounters each time you play its a different experience."}]}]}
{"context": "This is one of the biggest games I have ever purchased. I am no where NEAR finishing and have already played for 150+ hours. Well worth the price, and you can EASILY get lost in the fantastic world of Skyrim. One thing I do want to mention that might have made a difference is I turned off the autosave feature because I read that this causes problems. The only problem I have now is sometimes I will get killed and lose the last half hour of play time so I make sure to save whenever I enter a town or before a big fight.In conclusion, I could talk about this game forever as you have seen. I love it and have a lot of trouble with not wanting to play it all the time. I am 33 and have been playing games for over 20 years and haven't been so addicted to a game in a long time. The way the game was designed you can easily play for 100 hrs (I played for 200 collectively) and still have quests to do. Most games don't produce in excess of 30 hours of gameplay let alone 100+. Because the world of Skyrim seems so infinite and there are so many quests the fun essentially never stops. The story is a great and epic tale of a chosen one called the Dragonborn, who has the ability to 'shout' like the dragons of old who flew high above the skies of Tamriel. Overall I believe it is one of the greatest (if not the greatest) RPS ever made thus far. You can also steal which will get you a bounty if someone sees you I think. I try to be a good law-abiding citizen and avoid jail so I am not sure of what constitutes a higher bounty.-Monsters/enemiesThere are a whole range of bad guys/things in the game from wolves and bears to various undead, machines and of course humans that want to kill you. I like the variety of enemies in the game and think they did a good job of creating them. You will be randomly walking along and be attacked by a bear/saber cat and with myself being a mage, I will be killed in two hits. The engine looks a lot better than Fallout3 or New Vegas. Yes, i understand that this game was created more recently, but still, there is an impressive difference in my opinion. The world of Skyrim is very colorful and very nice to look at. There is a lot of details in the different game world area you venture into. The menus are gorgeous and very pleasant to look at also which is a definite plus.SOUND - The music in this game is top notch.

{"context": "Amazing game the glitches cant even knock the 5 stars.The intollerable load time, the fact you get to one of the main bosses and there is a glitch where he is invulnerable some how, the sound glitch if you play to long none of this could stop my 5 star ratingbut I bought this for ps3 reading all the glitches are fixed. That is a lie. Blatant lie. I dont like being lied to so I posted this review. I would suggest buying this game on PC. Dont buy this on console for the fact you cant fix glitches you can only load previous save points. If your not already a fan of the game or the series, this is the perfect place to start, while longtime veterans would probably regret not getting the full experience. However, it IS very pricey for the DLC but most die hard Elder Scrolls Lovers will probably feel it's worth it, especially because you can't just download the updates from the internet. And those who have no ability to connect their PS3 to the internet (there seems to be a lot of people like that, including me) this physical disc is the only way to access these extras. This game is AMAZING!! Enough said!!! But amazon wants more... if you liked any of the Elder Scroll games and/or love this style of RPG then this game is for you. I think everyone should know about the Invulnerable Alduin glitch and that it cant be fixed on any console only on PC. I heard ps4 and xbox 1 dont even have ssd HD's..... I guess Im gonna have to buy a nicer PC so I can experience skyrim the way its supposed to be experienced the load times get worse the longer the game goes on console. Thats Xbox or ps3 I am not knocking either console just I cant believe they haven't upgraded to SSD to get rid of these absurd load times.Amazing game though.

{"context": "(WARNING: A few spoilers)I as a female gamer grew up on games like Wolfenstein and Doom (the originals). I could not WAIT for this game to come out! Everything I saw previously looked amazing. Once I saw the Doom 4 Beta would be included of course I pre-ordered it! Sadly, I am regretting spending $60.00 on this terrible game.The GOOD:-The Graphics: They are as gorgeous as everything I've seen previously online.- The dogfood and treasure were included! Does anyone actually check for this stuff anymore?- No Doom beta if you don't have an online Xbox account or whatever they're called. For a game which celebrates the fact that not everyone wants to play online (which I don't and never have), it fails to provide access to one of it's selling points (it's on the front cover!!) unless you have an online gaming subscription. Ridiculous.- The usual theme of pointing out the obvious is evident once again. Ugh! Remember the good old days when FPS games made you wander around the map looking for something you needed or leaving it up to you to pick something up which may or may not be useful? This game would have been great were it not for all the fowl language, which, after serving in 2 different combat zones, I could almost ignore, but where I drew the line was with the pornography. I wander why the writers thought it was needed. The game would have been great without it. How many young people will be playing this game? Oh well, guess few people care today. I personally thought games like 'Rainbow 6: Vegas', 'Bioshock 1 & 2', and 'BLACK'(even though they are all older games)were much more complete and effective in creating a more menacing and unpredictable experience; I know they are all semi-different games, but they all had a purpose in mind, and some pulled it off much more successfully than others...Again, this isn't a horrible game, but just not what I had hoped I guess. I can't fault the thought and technical efforts that went into this project in any way; I was just hoping for more of a well rounded, involving experience that didn't always feel like an exercise in video game mechanics or sound/graphical presentation. Lowenstein is a very good game and that's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 5. It's not a great game as I've come to expect from the producers. For a FPS I would have expected to move freely around the game almost like Fallout or Fallout Vegas, but this is not the case as it is a little to comic for my taste. Plus they are waiting far to long to add to the game as I noticed the game is waining and players are running the game in fast track. My advice to you is to wait until they start adding to the game before you purchase so that you can maximize your purchase.", "qas": [{"id": 143, "question": "Does this come with the Doom Beta?

{"context": "I actually like the game a lot, but the problem is that it is VERY short...coming in at around 8-10 hours of single gameplay. The graphics are okay, but nothing spectacular or anything you've not seen before. There's an older Wolfenstein for the 360 simply titled &#34;Wolfenstein&#34; that is MUCH MUCH longer, and I highly recommend that title over this. Further, there's &#34;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&#34; for the original Xbox that I also recommend rather than this.Good game, but I cannot recommend it due to the very short game length. This game is super Awesome! It's one of the best games I've ever played. The frame rate is excellent, it's very fluent. The gameplay is amazing, very intense FPSing and the enemies are awesome. The story however needs some work. the ending was a bit of a let down, the main characters voice acting was very dull, and the characters are easily forgettable. It's very hard, I kept dying a million times every step of the way. If you're playing this game for the first time, I suggest you play it on super easy mode. another movie, oops game seem s like a movie with all the cut scenes. and it has 4 discs of them. still overall it was a decent game to play. a little short for total game play. but i'll go back and play the uber campaign. There is a lot of graphic violence, some sex, and some bad language so it is really an adult game. Overall it is a great FPS and a lot of fun to play. I believe it has five difficulty levels but would think I would start at level 2 or 3. I started on level three and it can get pretty tough on some of the missions. If you enjoy first person shooters with lots of action and a good story line this one is for you. How the hell did I get in a train? How did a Polish woman manage to get on a Nazi train?

I'd say save the money and just head there for the game. Otherwise, the first game and vr mission are just downloads from psn and the rest of the games are on disc, mgs4 being on its own and the rest on disc 1. The book is a nice addon and shows off the posters and some other art for the series. I'd say to buy this if you can get it for the 50 dollars or less instead of buying the hd collection, mgs 4 and mgs 1 separately. this is the best game everi remeber a friend came to my home on ps1 times and he bring this game (mgs1) and now i still have it but i dont have the casethis was the first game that i didnt skip cinematicsim from ecuador and i dont know if im writing this ok but i dont carei love this game ( konami(DOT)jp/mgs4/uk/interview/03.html ) This results in a game that tries to do way too much and struggles to make it all coherent.The gameplay builds on MGS3's new gameplay system with more refined sneaking and shooting mechanics (like crouch-waling/TPV aiming), but sadly the level design for parts of the game aren't as open or free as MGS3, and like MGS1 and 2, the second half of the game has too many set-pieces and areas with no enemies at all.

This collection comes with all of the main installments in the franchise including the VR Missions in Metal Gear Solid as well as an artbook and the graphic novels redone in movie form with great voice acting.

{"context": "Does there really need to be a metacritic rating on this Metal Gear Solid collection? This kinda bums me out a bit. Also, the original playstation Metal Gear Solid and the VR missions are only digital download based. This is kinda inconvenient. Wish they were on the discs. Finally I am able to play the Metal Gear (MG) and Metal Gear Solid games on my PS3! The games are pretty much presented in chronological order with MG and MG2 found in the MGS3 menu and MGS included as a download. I would have preferred to have MGS on one of the discs instead of having to download it, but I believe this is to discourage buying it used (download uses a code that may be used by only one person with a PS account).The series follows the Metal Gear story from Big Boss's beginnings in 1964 to his genetic son's, Solid Snake, final confrontation with the Patriots, an untouchable political organization controlling world war and economies in 2014. This game is released on two blu ray discs and covers eight games and has two videos included as well. The games go as far back as the original Metal gear and Metal gear 2 (which was oriinally dgeveloped for the MSX and ported to consoles worldwide). But it also includes all of the Metal Gear Solid games from the original all the way up to Metal Gear Solid 4. This is a deal in and of itself because if you were to purchase all these games separately it would cost you over $200 if not more.There are also two videos that are included which are motion comic adaptations of the Metal Gear graphic novels. if you need to read an amazon review for this game....you are misinformed! a collection of some of the greatest videogames to ever be developed, if you have never played MGS you need to buy this! Mainly bought this because of the inclusion of Peace Walker, but i pretty much collect these games at this point anyway.

{"context": "Loved how they used the original metal gear solid, instead of twin snakes. Obviously the quality of twin snakes was more visually acceptable, but the old ps for some reason always had this edge and darkness to them, resident evil series, Dino crisis, silent hill, and metal gear solid. Plus I felt giving the soldiers &#34;AI improvement&#34; in twin snakes took away from the games end, in particular the &#34;pal&#34; key card which is pivotal for liquids &#34;outer heaven&#34; motives to be in place. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars, is with all the gusto this puts forth its missing Twin Snakes. Quite frankly I don't care if Hideo Kojima worked on that or not, it kills a definitive collection to not include ever related title in a collection that claims to be 25 yrs of a series in a package. Otherwise, this is a well done collection. The bonus materials are interesting, and for those of you who had trouble finding them, because they are all squirrelied up, the original Metal Gear 1 & 2 are actually INSIDE Hetal Gear Solid 3 HD game menu. You can't beat getting a collection like this at such an affordable price. I only wish they could have included Twin Snakes (even as a replacement for MGS, but since it's nintendo only i see why they couldn't) and portable ops as it's canon to the story. This is as close to a modern update to the original 2 games from the 80s as we'll get. These are pretty awesome in and of itself but the crowning achievement of this legacy collection has to be the booklet that is included with this game. This 100 page booklet has tons of promotional items and brochures that are related to the MGS franchise. Is this a complete set of all the games that were released by Konami? No. But it is pretty close as it is only missing two games (twin snakes and portable ops). And these game are all remastered for HD so they will look absolutely gorgeous on your television.If you're a fan of the MGS Series you need to pick this up as you will now have almost every MGS game on the PS3. They also made a second one called Metal Gear Solid 2: Bande Desinee, which has the same comic-graphic novel-esque style, but it's a representation of the events that occurred in MGS2: SoL. This 2nd one was only on DVD though, there wasn't an interactive game version of it. Anyways, these two movies, remade in HD and once exclusive to Japan are what you're getting with this collection.One last thing.

{"context": "This is a really superb collection of all original Metal Gear games ever released. The only reason why this will not get 5 stars is because the code for MGS1 is region locked to the US. But even for European customers and without MGS1, this is still a more than awesome collection of 25 years of one of the greatest gaming brands. Fantastic series. Just a shame that DLC codes are NOT region free like PS3 games are supposed to be (but I understand that some regions have certain content only available to them). Other than that It's a great series of games. The game metal gear solid and VR missions doesn't work if you are in a Scandinavian region. The voucher code will only work if you're in north America. There is no help at all. Like how MGS2 is often misunderstood as \"pretentious\", MGS3 is often misunderstood as \"simplistic.\" It's true that the game isn't as in-your-face with its message, but that's what makes it great; you get to *feel* the game's message. Your own perception of the world is changed along with Big Boss. It tricks you into thinking this is just a fun, James Bond-esque spy thriller game, only to turn that perception on its head by the end.This is also the first game in the series that doesn't have too many set-pieces for the second half of the game; there are still a few, but for the most part the game sticks to its core sneaking gameplay for the entire game. Which is good, because MGS3 overhauls the core mechanics to fit the more natural, down-and-dirty, \"survivalist\" nature of the game. Areas are much more open and more beautiful, guards can now see farther and hear footsteps, and your visibility is determined by the Camo Index (you can change camos at any point in the game, but I found this to be a cheap way to complete the game. These days, I just use the default camo and only change either when the mission required it, or when I'm sneaking in the mountain area.", "qas": [{"id": 154, "question": "Which region is this game in?

For the sake of collector's value a physical disc of Metal Gear Solid and VR Missions might've actually been better.Nevertheless, on its own, the collection is probably one of the best collections you could get for Metal Gear Solid. It's a pretty decent price for all that you're getting with it. You might have to think for a moment if you've already got the HD Collection in your hands, but for the inclusion of the graphic novels, the downloads for the original Metal Gear Solid and VR Missions as well as the artbook, it might just be worth trading in your HD Collection and simply replacing it with this one. This collection also includes Metal Gear Solid VR Missions (a compilation of side missions played with the MGS1 mechanics) once again like MGS1, has to be downloaded via voucher code included in the box. Also included are 2 graphic novels which can be viewed as 2 full length movies based on the Metal Gear Solid 1 & 2. I have played and completed all of these games in the past except for VR Missions, but I appreciate the HD transfer for all games and even the trophy system which are nice. The only gripe I have with this collection is the omission of &#34;Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops&#34; which in my opinion is an important canonical story in the series; however the reasoning behind this was because Hideo Kojima did not direct the game himself and only served as an executive producer. This review assumes that you are at least somewhat familiar with the Metal Gear franchise.This particular collection comes with pretty much the entire saga all in one place. You'll get the original Metal Gear Solid.

{"context": "MGS1 takes place after the Cold War, as the world deals with its after-effects (like surplus nuclear weapons and scientists.) And yet, despite these differences, you can see that there are still many similarities between what both Snake's experienced (the convo with Snake and Naomi, after the second round of torture, best illustrates this point.)

{"context": "This is a really superb collection of all original Metal Gear games ever released. The only reason why this will not get 5 stars is because the code for MGS1 is region locked to the US. But even for European customers and without MGS1, this is still a more than awesome collection of 25 years of one of the greatest gaming brands. Absolutely love the Metal Gear Solid series. As a teenager I logged well over 100 hours into MGS2, collecting every dog tag I could possibly reach.As an adult, I'm blown away by how much better the game looks in HD. They put a lot of effort into modernizing the graphics and the payoff is superb. The cutscenes look much nicer. The graphics (and textures) are sharp and the framerate is locked in at a silky-smooth 60FPS - a *HUGE* increase over the original version that could be quite choppy at times. The game metal gear solid and VR missions doesn't work if you are in a Scandinavian region. The voucher code will only work if you're in north America. There is no help at all. Fantastic series. Just a shame that DLC codes are NOT region free like PS3 games are supposed to be (but I understand that some regions have certain content only available to them). Other than that It's a great series of games. If your looking to experience the whole metal gear saga this is the collection for you, not only is Metal Gear one of the best sagas of all time but with this collection your gonna understand and live the whole Metal Gear world and trust me it's worth the 60+ hours of gameplay.", "qas": [{"id": 157, "question": "Would this game work on my PS3 (I live in the UK)?

{"context": "Then my daughter start studing violin so it pushes me to take my old acoustic guitar that till the moment was more a toy than an instrument because I have never learned to play it.Then for father's day I gift to myself the Xbox Rocksmith Guitar Bundle. Now the music is our family hobby and my son got a guitar bass for 2013 christmas. This game/method give us a common language between my adolecent son and I.I was very satisfied till I gift a dance game for Kinect to my daughter. So the conflict was I play Rocksmith or she plays her dance game. I got a few weeks ago this bundle, it was a pain to configure at first, changing audio specs, and it didn't activate properly until a day pass, i never understood why, but after it, this software for learning and playing turn to be more than I thought it will. It definitely surpass my speculation and i enjoy it a lot, maybe it lack some songs, and the DLC song are not enough for some taste, I just wanted to learn a Cat Stevens song too, but its not included, otherwise the lack of songs and a pain to install and run it without any audio delays or bad configure. So I loved the original Rocksmith. It's been a blast playing along with modern music. There are some bugs. You have to do some optimization to get your playing to sync up with what you see on the screen due to the HDMI delay but it's workable.So I ordered Rocksmith 2014 so I can have an extra cable to play along with my wife. I get the CD. I plop it into the drive to install. Enter the key and guess what.&#34;Failed to connect to Key Server&#34;So I look at the Steam forum and I find a number to call Ubisoft Tech support: 1-888-610-2622Tech support tells me it's a problem with Steam. i had always fancied learning the guitar ut it was one of those things i never got around to doing. Since purchasing this i bought a lead guitar ESP AX-360 LTD and a bass ESP F-54 LTD.The lead first but found i was getting nowhere as i could not locate all the strings and get my head around the fretboard. i was then that as i am determined to master both i bought the bass. this is a lot easier to master although it a little harder on the finger tips.It is loads of fun to play and is well cool to be able to jam along with your favourite artists via the DLC or the many customs that are about.one thing i have found is that you need to have separate speakers to the ones on a tv and not use ones via a hdmi cable as it gets lag (says this in the documentation) not sure why it does not support digital audio but its no big deal tv speakers are never going to be as good as a cheap 2.1 system. I am getting older, and with that there are things that I find myself wanting to do that I failed or did not have the drive to actually do it. One of those things was to learn how to play electric guitar. I thought it would be nice to learn a musical instrument - just to know how, for my own sake - an instrument that always seemed rad, but I was too intimidated to play was the electric guitar.INSTALLATION:30 minute installation.Installed: Steam, UplayNOTE: The product registration code is on a notecard in the game case.", "qas": [{"id": 158, "question": "I want to buy this bundle for Mac, but my disc drive has failed.

{"context": "After about 20-30 minutes I was moving through the basic chords somewhat proficiently and after about an hour I was even picking up on some bar chords which i have never figured out how to play before. There's something about getting shot down by alien ships if you get it wrong that is extremely motivating. I also made progress on learning Sixteen Saltines by Jack White. Anyway this game is really fun, extremely easy to use, and in my opinion one of the best ways for impatient, lazy people, such as myself, to learn to play guitar. Rocksmith has brought me farther in one week than months of instruction. As a beginner guitar player, this if fantastic! ! A lot of tuning the guitar it should be called Tuningsmith. I was playing Heart Shaped box which has a different tuning (no big deal), but it suggests to go to Chords 101 (which requires a different tuning). Why can't I practice the chords with the alternative tuning? A lot of good songs and variety. Overall, I think as I adapt it will make more sense, for a new player a little more instruction would be nice From a complete nooby at guitar, am dissapointed in lack of basic instruction in the Lessons section. Unless I missed something, couldn't figure out which fingers to use where and when during practice and the speed of the practice riffs in the lessons is crazy. It does slow down for you after multiple fails, but still is frustrating. It needs more hand holding starting out, and slower progression, very confusing. The pace at which the lessons go seems to assume you know something. Considering the claim that it is the &#34;fastest way to learn guitar&#34;, I found myself setting this &#34;game&#34; aside and getting a few books to get some basic fundamentals down first. To me ROCK BAND is a game - because you have a 5 button joystick guitar and you really don't learn anything of value. This is GUITAR instruction. It still will take time - and effort, but this makes practicing FUN.&#34;GET IT&#34; - I'm also a bit disappointed in that I paid 79.99 for PC/MAC (I use Mac) rather than my PC's. and I see it on sale here today for Xbox and PS for 45% off.

{"context": "This product is a Steam activation key for Rocksmith 2014 and an attached cable. There is a CD that includes software for activating the key over Steam, but it is necessary to use. Unfortunately, the activation key was defective. It seems to be an issue with this particular product, not for everyone, but more than just me. Since I got a review copy from Vine, I did check first to make sure that others who purchased the product were getting activation errors. The Ubisoft forums showed a few reports of this as do other reviews here.I then contacted Ubisoft. During installation you will receive a Steam notification pop up with a secondary activation code with the option to \"copy to clipboard.\" This activation code is different than the one supplied in the box and you will need to enter it in uplay to install later in the install process. Select the option to copy to clipboard and continue with installation until prompted for the activation code. IMPORTANT: WHEN PASTING THE ACTIVATION CODE, BE SURE TO REMOVE ANY SPACES BEFORE OR AFTER THE CODE. LEAVING A SPACE BEFORE OR AFTER THE CODE WILL LEAD TO AN ERROR SAYING THE CODE IS NOT VALID. Rocksmith 2014 is supposed to be a guitar learning program disguised as a game that makes learning guitar fast, and more importantly, fun. Unfortunately I am unable to install this product on my PC as it requires being downloaded from Steam, after entering the provided \"Steam Activation Key\" into the Steam client. Sadly, the key provided is not accepted by Steam, therefor rendering Rocksmith 2014 unable to install or play. Entering the key gives an error saying a different product has to be activated first.I contacted Steam support about this error, and after an entire week of waiting on a response, they simply told me that they won't accept the key and to contact Ubisoft for a new key, and that they were pleased they could resolve my issue for me. &#34;Steam&#34; is a great concept, but totally fails in execution. Even though I successfully opened a Steam account online, registered the activation key from the game case, and installed the game on my computer, guess what? Steam won't issue a &#34;key&#34;, so I STILL can't do anything! It either says &#34;Failed to connect to key server&#34; or spends up to an hour saying &#34;Requesting a key&#34; without actually getting a key. This game is solid!After reading so many negative reviews, I was a little hesitant to buy this (especially regarding the activation key not working). Installation was easy, and activation went without a hitch. Yes, it installs the SteamPoweredGames client, and a Uplay member ID. I've played it for 2 days and I have not seen a single advertisement sent to my email. I'm guessing the people complaining about that was in a hurry and didn't uncheck the 3rd party product ads on the email installation page. Every software install has this option.Also, I'm using an older POS Yamaha guitar that sounds awful on an amp but works great with the Tone Cable.", "qas": [{"id": 160, "question": "is this have activation key?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 181, "text": "Unfortunately, the activation key was defective."}, {"answer_start": 0, "text": "This product is a Steam activation key for Rocksmith 2014 and an attached cable."}, {"answer_start": 1289, "text": "Unfortunately I am unable to install this product on my PC as it requires being downloaded from Steam, after entering the provided \"Steam Activation Key\" into the Steam client."}, {"answer_start": 2348, "text": "This game is solid!After reading so many negative reviews, I was a little hesitant to buy this (especially regarding the activation key not working)."}, {"answer_start": 1977, "text": "Even though I successfully opened a Steam account online, registered the activation key from the game case, and installed the game on my computer, guess what?"}]}]}
{"context": "I've enjoyed my Rocskmith software since day 1, and used my RS interface to play with other software as well: TH2, Garageband on my MacBook Pro and Air. The Ana/Digi interface makes it perfect to play without noise or squeals. Rocksmith 2014 for MAC (on Steam) is wicked fun AND a decent teaching aid.Plays/works very well on both my iMac and macbook air. It has a ton of diversity within the game from lessons, guitar controlled video games, learn a song, and an open ended session mode which all work great to keep things fresh, fun and challenging. From my end, on a pretty new Macbook Air, there's no audio delay to my speakers. That's important because I had read on a preview that there was an audio delay. I suspect the developers improved that issue from when that preview was written.As for learning guitar, I can say that it's just as or better than the previous Rocksmith games in terms of being a teaching tool. The session mode allows you to customize the way you play and learn, and when you realize you're doing specific scales over progressions, riffs and chords, you're learning music theory that can be applied beyond the guitar. My first install led to several crashes, usually within the first 10 minutes of playing. I borrowed a somewhat newer nVidia card and the crashes disappeared. I've never been a fan of the Guitar Hero genre of games since it just looks like a more organized version of air guitar, but this is definitely more fun and useful! I received Rocksmith 2014 and couldn't wait to get started. The software seemed to download fine but when I try to connect with the steam network I get a message that states: &#34;Cannot connect to the Steam network.

{"context": "So everytime you start up you need to tab out go to control panel and adjust the sound so the computer can hear the cable. You also need a powered USB that is providing at leas 100 mA to the cable by itself or the cable doesn't work. I have a secondary problem I debugged multiple times and got the cable to work, then it started making white noise and not able to register the sound. I tried several guitars and then plugged those guitars into my amp. NO problem with my guitars. The cord I believe is bad on its own and seeing as I got it on a Saturday the tech support isn't open. The premise is awesome, and some of the features (loading times between songs, access to practice tools) are MUCH improved over the original. But the 2014 version has its own problems.The two most annoying, for me, are:- Sometimes the player guitar sound changes from the song-specific tone to a clean, unprocessed tone. Think of what the guitar would sound like plugged in directly to a mixer or computer with no pre-amp of any kind. Blech. This can happen after one song or 5-10 but it happens. This game is awesome. In 2 days, I became a PC troubleshooter and a Rockstar. If you know how to work with computers very well, you might be able to figure out how to make the game play shortly after installation faster than I did. I had to search the forums a bit in order to fix the &#34;white screen&#34; lockout and spent sometime trying to make my PC read that the guitar was plugged in. You can probably avoid this headache if you buy for PS3 or XBox. Well let me say I am 54 and this Program Rocks! Installation was very easy first I downloaded Steam and then Uplay and updated both then set my sound settings just like they tell you on the Ubisoft website inserted the disc and followed the on screen instructions then plugged in my Real Tone Cable to my computer then the Guitar started the game it needed me to tune the Guitar so it walked me threw that then I went to lessons tab and started to learn to play Guitar.I had zero problems with installation and no problems running the software I find it easy to use and very helpful. Okay, this is my first Amazon review because I wanted to share what I have experienced so far with this software. First, I have played guitar off and on for about 40 years now and this program has helped me make excellent progress in a few weeks of playing.Pros:First, it was an easy PC install.

{"context": "This game has done nothing but glich the whole time I have owned it. Its a great concept but the software is crap. I have tried to download this game on three different computers. One a two year old laptop-failed One a home computer- worked for a few days then it started glitching. Then I went out and bought a brand new home computer made for gaming installed the software and after two days the software started glitching again. I took the laptop and computer to the geek squad thinking that it was just user error. Now that I have it installed it works well. It installs 3, count'en THREE, separate programs to run this one program. You have to stumble through the installation until you finally get there. The program doesn't initially auto-start; I spent an easy hour trying to get ROCKSMITH to start. Once it was installed the program wouldn't recognize my acoustic electric guitar (see separate review) I had bought for the program. I wound up buying an electric guitar. This is what majority of 1-star reviews complain about. The cool thing is that you can install the game on any number of computers you own and your game progress will stay in sync on all of them, thanks to Steam. The game cannot be played simultaneously on multiple computers, of course.I am an advanced guitar player (have been at it for over 15 years, on and off), but I still found it fun to go through a bunch of songs and lessons. It takes a little bit of time to get used to the fretboard display, but things get a lot easier with some practice. I can't really speak for the gameplay because I never got that far with the installation!First I think it was a horrible idea to have to run this through Steam AND Uplay. One or the other ok I understand, but not both with two separate CD keys.My PC is very new/nice and up-to-date (I won't list specs as everyone does because I don't believe that is the point of this review).Basically I could never get it to play for one reason or another, and that's after hours of figuring out how to install it.

{"context": "I expected to drop in this DVD and install the software. But no. First it installs Steam, where you need to set up an account. The it installs Uplay, where you need to set up an account. Then you can finally add Rocksmith 2014 to the menu of games. There are more passwords and logins for this thing than necessary. Finally, I get it up and running and it tells you to plug in the cable. Nothing happens. Plug - unplug. Plug - unplug. Nothing. I figured a reboot might make the difference. Within the first month of ownership, my cable would not work. The guitar works fine and I've made sure my jack and pickups are all in working order. When I plug the cable into the PC, the guitar sounds like static. The day before and the cable worked, the next day it was crap and completely broken. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND! I changed the sound card sample rate in properties, turned exclusive on and off to no avail. I also use 1 of 2 external USB Audio interfaces for pro-audio recording. I plugged that in and it started with no error but the sound was garbled. I went back to the built and card and tried a few more things. Now I did just update to Windows 8.1 so I figured let me try to install an updated driver. Bada bing that worked! Now most of the time I do use 1 of the external audio interfaces because they allow me to have the lowest latency (delay you hear for when you play your sound vs actually hear it). Please note. This review is for the PC version of the game.I had seen great reviews of the game so bought the PC version. Boy I was in for a lesson on how to fix my PC. Instead of a plug and play game, I spent days upon days fiddling with configuration files and USB drivers. Changed PC, no play, changed windows version from xp to win 7 to win 8, no play. Finally had to give it up and return the game. The only good experience was the easy return policy of Amazon. You still get the lesson and the intent of the video. It's just not 100% smooth. I could probably tweak settings to get it to work perfectly. I plug the headphone out into a small stereo near my laptop so that I can turn it up appropriately. The in song audio is very good.I took lessons years ago, but still started at the beginner level. One of the things I have the hardest time with is remembering what color goes to which string.

There are songs in all ranges of difficulties that will challenge anyone.The delay when playing the guitar to the computer is almost none. Almost immediate response and it does not detract from playing even when doing a full speed, multi-note, solo. As for what Rocksmith 2014 offers, it is almost perfect.Additionally on the game is the ability to 'jam' free style where you can select different instruments (and set the pitch/tempo etc)to form a virtual band if you feel the need to just play out some melodies in your head or want to practice what you have learned. New and modern rock songs are the order of the day here, and the beginner's approach to each and every song is what you get in impressive detail. Like learning anything of value, this will be a big challenge to some being that the framework for Rocksmith lies within a video game console, but with the proper patience will reap big rewards if you stick with it.I equate learning guitar with Rocksmith with learning a foreign language through Rosetta Stone: extremely informative, painstakingly detailed, and fun to learn through a thoughtfully laid out interface. This was the only thing I was looking forward to this Christmas, and it turned out to be a total piece of s***! WORTHLESS ON PC. After going through the hour of updating stupid crap and finally getting my G.D. cable to work, it would freeze up and shi the bed every time I tried to do a lesson.

{"context": "The play/sound recognition is also greatly improved as in the previous version I had issues with game not giving me credit for some pieces that I sensed I played correctly and game would say I had mistakes and not advance the level. Same piece (imported from v1), same player (me) and same passage, would be recognized OK in new version. Talking about this, would be good to notice that the game is much better at pointing you on your mistakes. The bad notes will be marked on the next tries of the same section. There are plenty of threads on Steam about your sound device and latency issues. I had to enable my onboard soundcard as my external M-Audio unit created extreme distortion and noise. It is because the onboard device has better latency with the Rocksmith Cable. Once you get the hang of the screen coming at you rather than scrolling by like a tablature player it's a lot of fun! Looking forward to jamming with my favorite bands and creating some new songs with the virtual band. More to come...Peace :) Yes I know I can buy a stand alone tuner and I have, but my son's friends seem wander off with them every time I buy one and it's harder for them to wander off with my whole PC, so there ya go.Oh and before I forget to mention it, session mode is awesome. Thanks to the origional RS I've improved from beginner to intermediate level playing and session mode gives you a place to jam. You tell it the style you want to play (metal, blues, etc) and it gives you a band (which you can change out different pieces to depending on what you want), you then tell it what key you want to play in, which scale you're planning on using, a tempo and go. Rocksmith will not work with it. Most consumers running this game are using the built in sound of their motherboard, but other users with external interfaces have the same problem - I have not heard of anyone successfully running an external interface.It almost seems malicious, that they are purposely disallowing you to use a multi-client audio interface, likely because they would enable you to (if you were inclined) copy the audio from your practice sessions and copy the backing tracks. There is no other reason I can see for them to do this.The only way I have gotten this to run is to disable my UFX and use headphones from the soundblaster on my audio computer. It adjust the speed depending on your proficiency and in rn increases the speed as you get better. All lessons are repeatable.

Turns out that isn't the case which is fantastic because I absolutely love the macro key setup and the nearly limitless color choices for the backlighting.I'll start with the pros:As I already stated, very high quality keys with a very robust feel.3 profiles for the 18 macro keys that can be quickly switched via hotkeys.Beautiful backlighting.Good weight ensures the keyboard won't slide about the desk.USB pass-through.Textured volume knob is far superior to your standard up and down keys.Very comfortable detachable wrist support.4 adjustment legs instead of just 2.Windows lock key is a great option for gamers.The membrane keys honestly compare pretty well to the cherry switches on my mechanical board.Lots of options for customization in the software available for download from Corsair.Cons:The only problem I've had so far is that when you try and fine tune the color of the backlighting you have to use the sliders for Red, Green, and Blue because the color palette is rather clunky. And as for gaming, I have had no problems with it, and there is a noticeable absence of distraction when I am playing.Con's: It probably took me about a day to get used to the new feel of the keys. Apparently, I had been so beat down by cheap keyboards that my brain did not fully comprehend what it had under my fingertips. But with every keystroke, I became quicker and faster. Now when I have to use another keyboard, it's feels like I'm driving a Yugo up a steep hill, which can be very annoying. This board has 18 programmable keys. G1-G18 on the left hand side, easily accessible. I will admit, it takes a minute to get used to using these if you are unfamiliar with extended keyboards such as this. If not, well kudos to you. The great part is that each of these 18 keys are programmable to 3 functions. Essentially this keyboard has 54 macros. You're welcome should be Corsiar's first response. The ability to switch with profiles is extremely easy using the M1, M2 and M3 buttons located right above the macro buttons.Next the LED. If you're not an avid gamer, you'll learn soon enough. Every keystroke is accurate, even if there are multiple keys pressed.The multimedia buttons on the board just show that Corsair really does think about what you use the most and what is most essential to have for quick access during the intense gaming streaks. Forget fiddling with your music options in game. No, you don't have to alt + tab. These buttons make life a lot easier, located right next to your board LED brightness control.Naturally this keyboard comes with the detachable full length wrist rest. This keyboard is amazing. You can't go wrong with this keyboard.I'm really pleased at how comfortable this keyboard is for general use and gaming. The keys are comfortable and easy to press.I really can't get over at what a dream typing and gaming is on this KB.A perfect gaming and general use keyboard. Tons of features for the price. For those that prefer a little less flash and little more form and function. This is for you.I find the wrist rest to be surprisingly comfortable as well.This is my 2nd Corsair keyboard purchase.", "qas": [{"id": 174, "question": "How high is the back of the keyboard raised with legs fully extended?

{"context": "My daughter and her two friends battle it out to see who scores the most points during a song. Yes, you need some space to have 3 kids dancing around to one song at the same time, buts its well well worth it. Kinect is funky as usual, but you can use the joystick to navigate the menus so that is a big bonus. Hopefully the Xbox One's Kinect 2 camera makes menu navigation a much more pain free experience. Overall, I recommend this game once again. Dance Central is more for the adults, but Just Dance is good for the kids. (In order to use Autodance you need a Xbox Hard Drive!) Karaoke tracks your voice and gives MOJO points on how accurate you sing while dancing! With those points, you could use it to \"buy\" Alternative song modes and mash ups.Ubisoft is making Just Dance games even better! Happy Dancing & Singing! This version is certainly more user friendly than the last edition they put out, but it still doesn't compare to the easy maneuverability of the older versions. This time they gave you controller access so you don't have to go through the very frustrating Kinect motion controls, but if I wanted to use a controller, I would have bought a Wii!! I have noticed a lot of the dance moves are starting to repeat themselves, so they need a little bit more creativity in that area. However, once you get to the song, they really are the best dance video out there. Just rate how valuable stuff is and as I play level me up and unlock stuff. Picking and choosing is just teasing when this isn't a strategy game where I need to choose between unlocking a stronger weapon, a stronger shield, or the length of time in which my enemies are stunned. The video feature where it captures you dancing and you can upload it later is extremely unnecessary. Dance Central has a free style section where you can do that but you can turn it off. I have not yet found a way to turn Just Dance's potential facebook black mail feature off. This is a fun game. It really is. But they never said that you had to pay for a few songs. On the list, it says a few are included but they were not included, I had to pay extra (about 2 dollars per song) for three songs that were said to be included. So, that was a disappointed, not a big deal but they should tell you that you need to purchase the other songs.

{"context": "I think the title sums it up. I currently own the previous version (Just Dance 4) and Dance Central 3. If you've ever played just dance and dance central you are familiar with the differences. In summary Dance Central is for learning more complicated moves and put on a one-person show, and Just Dance is for being goofy, partying with friends while dancing.What I like about the new version:1) Karaoke. This is great. If you are in perfect shape and you can both sing and dance good for you. Just Dance began as a humble Wii game, but has grown to become the only serious competitor to Harmonix's Dance Central in the realm of Kinect dance games. Both franchises offer similar gameplay: You try to mirror an avatar's dance moves, while upcoming moves are flashed on the side of the screen. But I'm intrigued by their differences.Loosely speaking, Just Dance is a party game, while Dance Central is a \"serious\" game. Dance Central encourages you to master each song by memorizing its moves in a special practice mode and working your way up from the easy difficulty level to medium to hard. if you are a great dancer, you can compete w yourself and others to outscore one another, and there is plenty of room on the upside to keep you interested.Unlike Dance Central, which we also own, this game is not really trying to teach you how to dance in a step by step way, or do specific moves (which Dance Central does very well, btw)- Just Dance assumes you can follow along with general, somewhat repetitive moves (like a workout) that requires some basic knowlege of dance-- like going to an advanced aerobics class-- some moves will be familiar to you if you have danced before, but will be much more challenging if you have not. Xbox Kinect dance games come down to two options every year: Just Dance and Dance Central. Which one you should buy is based on what you want out of it. Just Dance is a party game (up to four players after unlocks) while Dance Central is more technically accurate dancing. As for me, I like them both. And I dislike them both. This is a review for Just Dance so let me tell you about this game.The game is fun, has a lot of current (2013) and classic songs, has vibrant visuals, and is easier to play. I like Dance Central 2 and 3, but I wanted to try out a different dancing game. Just Dance is just as good as Dance Central. The Kinect picked up on my motions pretty well, and it's a lot of fun to play if you don't value your dignity too highly. I don't know much about pop music, which makes up the majority of the music selection, so if it's out of date, I wouldn't know. Either way, it's easy to dance to, though like all pop music, the beat tends to drag.", "qas": [{"id": 176, "question": "is it like dance central", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2231, "text": "I like Dance Central 2 and 3, but I wanted to try out a different dancing game."}, {"answer_start": 193, "text": "In summary Dance Central is for learning more complicated moves and put on a one-person show, and Just Dance is for being goofy, partying with friends while dancing.What I like about the new version:1) Karaoke."}, {"answer_start": 1091, "text": "if you are a great dancer, you can compete w yourself and others to outscore one another, and there is plenty of room on the upside to keep you interested.Unlike Dance Central, which we also own, this game is not really trying to teach you how to dance in a step by step way, or do specific moves (which Dance Central does very well, btw)- Just Dance assumes you can follow along with general, somewhat repetitive moves (like a workout) that requires some basic knowlege of dance-- like going to an advanced aerobics class-- some moves will be familiar to you if you have danced before, but will be much more challenging if you have not."}, {"answer_start": 2606, "text": "Either way, it's easy to dance to, though like all pop music, the beat tends to drag."}, {"answer_start": 2002, "text": "As for me, I like them both."}]}]}
{"context": "I have not played JD2014 too much yet, but I have to say that is partially because it doesn't seem as fun/captivating as Just Dance 4. I primarily play JD4 with my 3 year old son and it is always a lot of fun and great exercise as well. Please take my review with a grain of salt as I have probably spent less than 2 hours with Just Dance 2014. However, I have spent MANY hours with Just Dance 4.I have two main issues with JD2014:1. Just Dance 2014 tried to imrpove/simplify the kinect menu interactions compared to Just Dance 4. I own Just Dance 4 and enjoy it quite a bit. Somehow JD2014 lacks the quality songs and the irreverent sense of humor of JD4. There are at least 10 songs in JD4 that everyone enjoys - Rock Lobster, Final Countdown, Istanbul, Call Me Maybe, What Makes You Beautiful, etc, etc. This one... maybe Blurred Lines. The dance moves seem boring and uninspired. Many times I get half way through a song and I'm like, geez I'm still dancing, when will this be over.This could all just be my personal preferences. I wish you could challenge people 1 on 1 (yes you can do a private session but you have no control of the songs). Also, there needs to be more variety to the online catalog. Seriously, they rotate the songs over and over and some routines just rarely ever get played. How about every now and then letting first place choose the next routine? How about letting us do DLC online too?But it's simply the best and as far as I know only game to accomplish online dancing (the rest are just leaderboards). I have met and friended several people this way. Anyways, I highly recommend this game. It's much more accessible dancing game than DC3 even though it's not as challenging, plus they are currently very active in adding DLC with a lot of pop music hits. As much as I tended to get frustrated with the Kinect accuracy in the menus in Just Dance 4, Just Dance 2014 seems to be more annoying to me and actually less fun if that makes sense. I liked the feel of &#34;depth&#34; with the JD4 menu interactions.2. Just Dance 2014 has a tweaked visual style compared to JD4. It is just as functional, but I find Just Dance 4's visuals to be more fun to look at. That might seem cosmetic, but this sort of game has to provide visual stimulation (along with the music) to keep you interested in essentially dancing like a fool and getting some exercise.I have not tried any of the new ONLINE multiplayer features.", "qas": [{"id": 177, "question": "Does the DLC from JD4 work with JD2014?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 576, "text": "Somehow JD2014 lacks the quality songs and the irreverent sense of humor of JD4."}, {"answer_start": 0, "text": "I have not played JD2014 too much yet, but I have to say that is partially because it doesn't seem as fun/captivating as Just Dance 4."}, {"answer_start": 345, "text": "However, I have spent MANY hours with Just Dance 4.I have two main issues with JD2014:1."}, {"answer_start": 1376, "text": "How about letting us do DLC online too?But it's simply the best and as far as I know only game to accomplish online dancing (the rest are just leaderboards)."}, {"answer_start": 2041, "text": "Just Dance 2014 has a tweaked visual style compared to JD4."}]}]}

It is extremely versatile with USB and analog plug-ins. We tried it for our Xbox 360, but my husband also tried it for the TV watching he does on the computer and with his smartphone. I'm traveling in March and can't wait to try this for watching films on my Kindle Fire. With that done, time for the verdict!Design/Appearance: 5/5Build Quality: 5/5Comfort: 3.5/5Features: 3/5Performance: 4/5Total: 20.5/25The Marvel Seven: A love letter to Marvel Fans. Built for the fans, this headset encompass everything that Thor himself would be proud of: A piece of gaming audio that can handle many situations well without a hitch and can easily go up against its many foes. If you are a die-hard Marvel fan, and you need Marvel paraphernalia, the Marvel Seven is an excellent choice. I have used this on my PC, my Vita, MP 3 player and a small camera and found the audio quality to be on par with what I expect from Turtle Beach. I am, and always will be a Turtle Beach fan, they've never made a product I didn't like and always seek to innovate on existing options.Price point though, can be a stickler for some - me being one of them. In games like Uncharted 2, dialogue, explosions, and gunshots were all defined and clear. The mobile chat/music was For other games like Black Ops 2, footsteps were good to discern, but that lack of DD 5.1 made it feel a bit awkward. It's not that the Marvel doesn't do Pro Logic IIx terrible, it is just that, without those other 3 channels of audio, you get a \"left or right\" direction. Again, not too hard, but won't be easy. For music, the Marvel was really good, much to my surprise. Everything got kicked up a notch, and games like Battlefield 3 showcase this with the Sevens easily handling high intensive sections of matches without blending in to the overall sound mix too much. While the driver size doesn't matter, the distortion between the two is this: The Marvel Seven is better, but not by much. Bass wise, again, I wish that the Marvel Seven had I bit more decay, but that is okay since the sound-stage was very pleasing to, even for closed back headphones, which usually have problems due to the compression of audio going into your ears.", "qas": [{"id": 178, "question": "playstation 3", "answers": [{"answer_start": 13, "text": "This bad boy comes with a range of different cables to ensure you can literally plug it into every device it says it supports: \"PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PC/Mac, and Mobile compatibility\"."}, {"answer_start": 1564, "text": "It's not that the Marvel doesn't do Pro Logic IIx terrible, it is just that, without those other 3 channels of audio, you get a \"left or right\" direction."}, {"answer_start": 977, "text": "I have used this on my PC, my Vita, MP 3 player and a small camera and found the audio quality to be on par with what I expect from Turtle Beach."}, {"answer_start": 473, "text": "With that done, time for the verdict!Design/Appearance: 5/5Build Quality: 5/5Comfort: 3.5/5Features: 3/5Performance: 4/5Total: 20.5/25The Marvel Seven: A love letter to Marvel Fans."}, {"answer_start": 1819, "text": "Everything got kicked up a notch, and games like Battlefield 3 showcase this with the Sevens easily handling high intensive sections of matches without blending in to the overall sound mix too much."}]}]}
{"context": "This is a tough headset for me to review, not because of the quality in construction or the audio it produces - both are typical Turtle Beach construction and performance which is very very good. Nor is it hard to talk about all the things that this will work on - dang near everything out there and then some.What makes this one hard for me is this is a very very good wired headset, and it does a lot and does it well. The thing is, the wires. I don't mind wires - though I prefer wireless myself - but when you get to the price point of this headset I feel that this should be a wireless set. I'm not really into head sets, games, videos, etc. like others, perhaps especially the younger set! However, I must admit that all the features available here, especially sound and sight, are top quality, and not difficult to figure out. And various family members love all the features here, and perhaps like explaining it to me as much (I am the Luddite in the group! )..They all tell me the gaming feature is great, and really fun, so who am I to argue! Wearing them literally feel like a pair of glasses, you know there are on you, but there is not that annoying or crushing feeling and it will rest securely of your head without gripping you like and angry crab claw.The cord is very well made and durable with the perfect length and once you have them on and are using them, the outside &#8216;white&#8217; noise disappears and in a couple of games I played I really felt like I was in a movie theatre with that surround sound and crystal clarity of many channels.I&#8217;m most impressed with its weight and comfort but when the clarity of the games natural soundtracks came on &#8211; I didn&#8217;t want to take it off. Normally I don't jump on the bandwagon of getting branded headphones especially after movies, however I had a birthday and had some cash to burn.

{"context": "Great sound (large drivers) but these fail to mention that they do not have simulated surround sound on them for PC users. I was a little disappointed when I went to set them up and their is only an option for stereo in windows 8.1. Other models for the same price range give 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound option. Now with that said, these sound awesome! With separate controls for chat and game and I can adjust the volume on the fly for either which is really nice since I am on TeamSpeak in almost every game I play. There are others you can buy on Turtles site of different Marvel Characters both heroes and bad guys to change the look by adding a favorite comic character (the Magneto and Venom ones look great. Would love to see them add Silver Surfer, Galactus and Thanos).This headset looks and sounds great. Turtle Beach has come out with a really good system with the Turtle Beach Marvel Seven: Limited Edition Gaming Headset. The accompanying chat control box allows for both voice and volume control when connected to a communal gaming situation. The mute features and functioning with the headset-microphone allow total control for others to hear you sharper and clearer too.Another fun fact about this headset is that it comes with swappable speaker plates to customize your headset to your favorite Marvel (or decorative) character. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s such a good selling point, but the clarity and comfort alone should be why you spend this kind of money on something like this. Turtle Beach must have heard the complaints of the XP Seven and made it a point to add durability to make Marvel and the Asguardian God himself happy, along with the fans. What about comfort? Let's continue on to that.Comfort:For comfort, while the inline amp is simple to use, the Marvel is good. While the neoprene mesh earpads are great, the clamping force is not. This thing is like vice-grips! They hurt that much, and it really is too bad, for the breathable ear-cups would make me wear these for hours on end. Add to that the ability to separate the microphone from the headset (which, let's admit, can get in the way when you're wearing a headset and have no need for the mic at that particular moment), and you've got a great headset that extends its usefulness far beyond just gaming, and into use for listening to music from your mobile device as well as for making calls from your smartphone.I can't see how anyone could ask for more if they're looking for quality audio and wide usage capability!This is my first Turtle Beach beadset, and I'm just blown away by the features that this headset has!", "qas": [{"id": 180, "question": "Is there an option that let's you change your voice?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1700, "text": "Let's continue on to that.Comfort:For comfort, while the inline amp is simple to use, the Marvel is good."}, {"answer_start": 233, "text": "Other models for the same price range give 5.1 and 7.1 surround sound option."}, {"answer_start": 123, "text": "I was a little disappointed when I went to set them up and their is only an option for stereo in windows 8.1."}, {"answer_start": 934, "text": "The accompanying chat control box allows for both voice and volume control when connected to a communal gaming situation."}, {"answer_start": 517, "text": "There are others you can buy on Turtles site of different Marvel Characters both heroes and bad guys to change the look by adding a favorite comic character (the Magneto and Venom ones look great."}]}]}

These were best headphones we found for the price & quality! We looked at a lot of other headphones, but these are the best! I'd recommend them to anyone looking for headphones. As a headset, they are focused towards gaming. I have tried them out in several games and find that they have a nice range and allow me to hear anything from footsteps 20 feet away to huge explosions with lots of rumbling bass. With a little tweaking to the in-line amp, they can be easily adjusted to any game type.When I used this headset to listen to music, they sounded fairly good as well but seemed to lack a bit in the high range. This is easily forgivable given how versatile this headset is.Overall I am very pleased with the Turtle Beach Marvel Seven and would recommend them to anyone who loves gaming and wants a multipurpose headset.

Somehow, it is able to generate sounds that appear to be coming from behind you, which is great for gaming. It has multiple presets that allow you to do things like amplify the bass for explosions, or footsteps for strategy. This version adds variable chat volume. With the chat volume, your discussions aren't drowned out by sound effects in the game.I have tried numerous headsets over the years, and this is by far the best for sound and comfort for both gaming and music.While it may be silly, I really like the Marvel styling of the headset. The Turtle Beach Marvel Seven: Limited Edition Gaming Headset is top quality. Right away the packaging impresses with the solid design of the box and case. Even though the set is constructed of plastic, it is really well made and durable. Also it comes with a variety of cords for different uses so that you do not need to go and buy them separately. The design is really great, Marvel Comics is a great fit for a set of gaming head phones. Very cool looking.As for the sound quality, this system really is excellent.

{"context": "This is a fantastic idea in principle, but it's very poorly implemented. If you buy this for multiplayer prepare to be disoriented. Any marvel Fan would be very happy with the cast.

Our first game console was the Nintendo Wii and we bought all the Lego games for my son, these are great games for everyone - I am an occasional gamer and love playing the Lego games.I bought this from a local retailer as prices for most games are pretty consistent whether bought online of through retailer (at the time I bought it - however see now that the price is $15.00 less than retail, a no brainer to buy it online).Like all previous Lego games you can take control of a multitude of characters, like Iron Man, Spider-Man, the Hulk, Captain America, Wolverine, and the Flame... and there are dozens and dozens of characters you can unlock, including some lesser known characters (won't spoil the fun and tell you which).The game can be played by two players as well so you can team up - the only thing that I don't like is the split screen, but not much you can do about it if you want to play multiplayer.With it being a newer game there are not a lot of cheats out there, which is GREAT as my son loves to hunt for cheats and get all the various benefits he found in the Wii version of the games, things like Fast Build, or multipliers.We both liked that the character speak, and sound effects are great. UPDATE: I added a video of me messing around in freeplay so you can see a little of how large and free the world is. Also at the end of the quick video I switch between a few characters so you can get an idea of who is available. Obviously I don't have time to show all 150 so I just randomly pick a few.I got this game because I wanted a 2 player game my girlfriend might actually like, and this was it.

{"context": "This is my very first foray into the Lego video games. I actually had bought the Indiana Jones and Star Wars itinerations for the PS3, but never even got to open the packages, let alone played them. I eventually gave them to my cousin, bypassing them for something childish.When the PS4 came out, the truth is the launch game line-up was rather underwhelming. I bought AC: Black Flag, FIFA 14, and Killzone. They were great games, but they just lacked something, something lightheartedly FUN.So when this game went on sale for $40, I bought it just for the heck of it, but also with help from all the 5 -star reviews here on Amazon. First a disclaimer: If you didn't like any of the previous 10-12 LEGO game releases, nothing here has changed drastically from the formula, and even if you're a Marvel fan, nothing in the gameplay realm is terribly different. So just take that into consideration when deciding about a purchase.I've played through several of these games (LEGO Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Pirates, etc) and this one is hands down the best of them all. Yes you've got to grind to unlock all the characters. Yes you've got to backtrack into previously visited areas to get everything. First time smasher! I've seen the Lego games throughout the years (Batman/Lord of the Rings/Star Wars/Indiana Jones etc...) except I've never played one. Seeing as today was PS4 Launch day I figured I'd give it a shot. I must say, &#34;intoxicating fun&#34;. Moms if your wondering if this is a game for your kids. Yes, though I always believe different children mature at different times. This game is a lot of smashing but its toy bricks not human bodies. I've played almost all of the other Lego video games whether it's Lego Batman, Lego Indiana Jones, Lego Lord of the Rings, etc. This one is by far the best of all. The variety of characters and abilities is pretty awesome. The characters look true to their comic/video form and their abilities are really cool. Don't kid yourself and think you won't like this game because you're an adult.....you will love it. I bought this for myself as an adult gamer and it has been hours and hours of fun. Well, I waited for hours outside for the PS4 to come out, finally got one. Grabbed a game soon after and thought LEGO Marvel Super Heroes would be fun. I've played a few other LEGO games in the past, Indiana Jones, Batman, and some others. All of which I liked, but, after a while, it was the same old thing. Picking this up I knew what I was getting into... or so I though.I popped it in (after hours figuring out how to update the PS4 with a USB/PSN being down).", "qas": [{"id": 191, "question": "is it like in the indiana jones lego or star wars when you push L2 or R2 it can switch between characters?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1216, "text": "I've seen the Lego games throughout the years (Batman/Lord of the Rings/Star Wars/Indiana Jones etc...) except I've never played one."}, {"answer_start": 55, "text": "I actually had bought the Indiana Jones and Star Wars itinerations for the PS3, but never even got to open the packages, let alone played them."}, {"answer_start": 859, "text": "So just take that into consideration when deciding about a purchase.I've played through several of these games (LEGO Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Pirates, etc) and this one is hands down the best of them all."}, {"answer_start": 1654, "text": "I've played almost all of the other Lego video games whether it's Lego Batman, Lego Indiana Jones, Lego Lord of the Rings, etc."}, {"answer_start": 2300, "text": "I've played a few other LEGO games in the past, Indiana Jones, Batman, and some others."}]}]}
{"context": "I'm glad I did.First of all, the character set is HUGE. I mean, you can discover and play up to 100 characters - where have you even heard of anything like this before?? I mean Mortal Kombat got a little ridiculous after a while, but this is just RIDONKULOUS.The storyline and writing are also very well done, with lots of adult references, and little digs here and there for the movie versions, as well as each other's backstories.The voice acting is also excellent. I was a bit disappointed to not have Robert Downey Jr. be associated with Ironman, etc., but actually as the story wears on, I got used to the new voices, and I even actually really like them, and I bet you will too.The Lego games are never known for their graphical prowess, so you would think on the PS4 it would be a waste. This game is perfect for my five year old, and my thirty-two year old husband as well! They both love playing the game, and the graphics are very good. The only thing that was a little confusing at first was how to switch to two-player mode. Some people, I have heard, complain about the fact that you are unable to play over-line with other players, however I, personally, like this. It means that when my five year old wishes to play, I do not need to worry about what he is doing. *Tons of playable characters. *Hours of enjoyment. Humor is pretty good (slapstick style. )*Story, cinematics, and even Deadpool are all clean. By this I mean no curse words, but does not take away from the quality of the writing, humor, and storyline (which is all over the place but thats ok.) I don't mind games having foul language, or even mild violence, but the line of G/PG/PG-13 is sometimes blurry when it comes to anime and video games. I love me the Lego series!

I can't review this game that very well because to see what it really is, is for you to watch a gameplay or buy it yourself. I was bored one day and went into the PS4 live show place where people broadcast and I found someone playing this and I got hypnotized by it by having so many characters and so much gameplay!

{"context": "Yes, the actual statue.Clearly, the series hasn't forgotten its sense of humour. Slapstick cut scenes and a script full of consistently charming wit are amusing enough to make even the most hardened cynic crack a teethy grin. Younger gamers are bound to find it hilarious.All of this is grounded within an open-world hub in the form of bustling Manhattan island. Before each mission starts, you're let off the leash to explore, skydiving dramatically from the SHIELD Helicarrier to the streets below. From there you can commandeer vehicles from helpful citizens, compete in timed races, take on sub-missions offered by numerous NPCs or just explore the open city seeking out tokens (which can be spent to unlock more characters).It's fun to burst around the city as Human Torch or Iron Man, but this is where some small niggling issues arise. I love me the Lego series! It's a known formula that Tt Games keeps nuancing in creative ways. This one in particular is a blast. It features gorgeous graphics with funny cutscenes and some hilarious cultural commentary. When Story Mode ends, replay factor is through the roof with Free Play. There are racing mini-games, timed skill sections and two million things that you're just going to want to smash and throw around as Hulk. As always, &#34;Free Play&#34; mode lets the completionist in you go hog-wild in search of bricks and mini kits. Huge step forward in the Lego game series. The missions are fun as usual but the real spice is going back in free play with the unlocked characters and oh boy are there a lot of them; both villains and heroes. The open world aspect is broadened even further this time which means you can fly around and explore the city as the human torch, swing from building-to-building as spiderman, steal someone's car (which they willingly give up to super heroes) GTA-style; this game has a lot to do and a lot of different and varied characters keeps it interesting. When not playing any of the core story missions, players are free to roam around a large city completing side missions and unlocking new content. Since Lego games tend to be short on story content, we appreciated the open world as a better method of delivering extra content as we don't overly enjoy replaying missions to drag out extra game time.Overall, I would recommend this game to fans of the series and to those looking for a co-op game to play with someone who may not be the typical target of video games (younger children or non-hardcore gamers). LEGO Marvel Super Heroes - PlayStation 4 is the best lego game ever created. The game has over 140 character that you can play as; it does not get better than this. If you have kids these games are tons of fun, and the story within the game is cute and silly. Your kids will love this game and its a good way for you to play with your kids as well.

{"context": "If you enjoy going around and playing as Marvel superheros it is a good game to play. I am only a little bit into it, but I'm really enjoying playing the game so far. Graphics are what you expect, and the controls handle the way they are supposed to. The hints need a bit of work. Of these, I find myself playing Lego Marvel the most right now.Two player Co-op is probably the most fun, and this game could be considered a &#34;button masher&#34;, but it works like a slightly more advanced arcade game where you need to solve puzzles in order to advance. You are given a certain set of characters for each level, and in using those characters, you must figure out how to advance using each member's specific abilities (Spiderman will need to climb to things and use his web to reach higher areas, Iron Man will need to shoot things down/fly to higher areas/use his laser to meltdown gold objects, Hulk will need to move large objects, battle larger bosses etc.). I bought this for my boyfriend so he could play something on my PS4 that wasn't a shooter and that we could both play together. The graphics are top notch and the framerate makes it practically look like a Pixar movie. The problems arise when you're playing co-op. The way they have chosen to divide the screen is extremely disorienting; when the co-op players are in close proximity they all appear on one unified screen, when the players stray from each other the screen divides itself into halves and remains halved until the players rejoin one another. I was agitated and had a feeling this game might let me down as well. It starts you out with the basic entry movies (very good animation and voice overs). It moves to game play and you instantly recognize your favorite Marvel heros. This was a nice intro. Tons of hidden humor! Kids will love it, but adults will definitely pull out the &#34;Did he just say that?&#34; parts. I played through a few hours (1-2) with the classic gameplay.Then, out of nowhere, it sets you in a city with LEGO Ironman / The Hulk. This if fun especially using the Hulk at the beginning to just break Legos to clear a road (ok so those legos are in the shapes of vehicles and such but it's fun)If I have to deal with any more story line preventing me from just playing I might have to downgrade to 4 stars ...COME ON, some time I just want to have some fun and don't really care about the plot ...If I can't figure out after a while then I might pay attention so I can get to the next part.", "qas": [{"id": 194, "question": "Can this game handle 1 - 4 players using 4 shock controllers?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 2032, "text": "This if fun especially using the Hulk at the beginning to just break Legos to clear a road (ok so those legos are in the shapes of vehicles and such but it's fun)If I have to deal with any more story line preventing me from just playing I might have to downgrade to 4 stars ...COME ON, some time I just want to have some fun and don't really care about the plot ...If I can't figure out after a while then I might pay attention so I can get to the next part."}, {"answer_start": 167, "text": "Graphics are what you expect, and the controls handle the way they are supposed to."}, {"answer_start": 1897, "text": "I played through a few hours (1-2) with the classic gameplay.Then, out of nowhere, it sets you in a city with LEGO Ironman / The Hulk."}, {"answer_start": 1521, "text": "I was agitated and had a feeling this game might let me down as well."}, {"answer_start": 1676, "text": "It moves to game play and you instantly recognize your favorite Marvel heros."}]}]}

On average you get a USB charger and it's in the neighborhood of 3 feet or so. This is comically undersized, maybe 6-8\" tops. It's like I bought a scale sized accessory for an action figure. I have the charger in a wall adapter next to my Lazy Boy, the cord barely reaches the floor so I had to move it to a power strip. Makes it very clumsy to access. Good sound, very comfortable. I have thick hair so over-the-ear ear buds get tangled in my hair but these don't. The sound is good. Battery holds a charge for a long time. My son liked them so much that he asked for a pair for Christmas. They fold compactly and come with a carrying case, which I like but it's just a little too large to fit well in my purse. Have been using this a couple weeks with my iPhone. Pairing was as expected, connections is reliable, and controls on the right earcup are easy to operate. The sound is fine for me, I use it mostly for exercise music and listening to podcasts or audible books. The price was right too.However as with another user, the fit and comfort are a deal breaker for me. The over-the-ear loops press hard against my head and chafe against my ears during exercise, limiting wearing time. I guess the good part of that is they won't come off easily! I really like these headphones. They are reasonably priced, they have a great mix of bass and treble, and they come with a hard case.

This is the kind of headphone that is worn looped over the ears and across the back of the head or neck. That took some getting used to. I found that when I wear glasses, sunglasses or regular, there isn't room on top of my ears to keep both securely in place. Because the bar can stick out behind my head/neck, I find that the best, most secure positioning is to rotate the earphones a little so that the bar rests against my lower neck. The bad part about this positioning is that, if I look up, the headphones move. Fortunately, that isn't something I do often while listening to music. Still, I took off a half-star for the awkwardness of not being able to adjust the length of the bar for a better fit.These headphones fold up to roughly a 5&#34; x 4&#34; size. They fit easily into the included rigid, zippered case. A short charging cable is also included, and it fits into a side pocket inside the case. The Bluetooth range is about average; I could walk about 24 feet from the source, with a wall in between, before the signal started dropping.These headphones are a great value, especially if you don't mind the over-the-ear, back-of-the-head style.

I have purchased 2 Mazer 2 mice. Both wireless and corded, Cobra 2 keyboard and the new Mazer Type-X gaming headset. My issue is the company is from East Asia so there is little support for the US market. The company claims everything is plug and play but Windows 8.1 does not like the base driver it has to use. The E-3lue website claims to have an all I one mouse driver but it's just a button configuration interface for their mouse. I sent an email to their support team and got a smug response and after filling out a detailed registration including the S/N which is on the box for US models and almost impossible to read for each item I got a response from their support team telling me to download the all-in-one mouse driver from the website which doesn't help at all for the keyboard and headset.

There is a wireless variant on this mouse, but the one I received was wired. I also noticed the default seller on the page has changed. These reviews are probably because of the change in seller. For future purchasers, the seller I bought my mouse from and received the wired version of the mouse was Bangplus, they are the highest rated of the currently 3 sellers selling this product. Hopefully this will help anyone wanting the wireless version of the mouse in the future.

The thumb rest could extend a bit more and there is no off switch for the LED light as well as no software for it. Braided cored, soft touch plastic, and just being comfortable in your hand make me really like this mouse. Couldn't take off the 5th star just because my hand isn't the shape of the mouse exactly and the plug and play feature is semi-nice. No way to customize DPI settings is the only downfall. Can just customize pointer speed accordingly. Still 5 stars. Of course the lights make the mouse look awesome, but as time goes by, it starts to get annoying. Also, the side buttons are of a lower build quality so they wobble and aren't as sturdy as everything else on the mouse. These issues are not so important with other users, so I left this mouse a 4 star to not be so biased.So once again, if you have ANY QUESTIONS that weren't answered in my review, please message me and I will answer them.

I have tried using every port which has been suggested by others to have worked for them, but no luck here. The only settings for the mouse are physically on the mouse -- the DPI and Hz switches.

If you don't know what that is, you've nothing to worry about. )All in all, this is a very wise purchase for an inexpensive gaming mouse, and one of my favorite purchases to date. I have zero complaints. It's constructed very well and has nice solid weight to it. The plastic has a soft coating on it that is pleasant to touch and the LED illumination is really cool. The primary buttons and the MMB click precisely and the scroll wheel is notched and very well damped. While the DPI speed must be cycled through (whereas the MX 518 has +/- buttons), I do like that its illuminated different colors to indicate what speed its in.

{"context": "I have purchased 2 Mazer 2 mice. Both wireless and corded, Cobra 2 keyboard and the new Mazer Type-X gaming headset. My issue is the company is from East Asia so there is little support for the US market. The company claims everything is plug and play but Windows 8.1 does not like the base driver it has to use. The E-3lue website claims to have an all I one mouse driver but it's just a button configuration interface for their mouse. I sent an email to their support team and got a smug response and after filling out a detailed registration including the S/N which is on the box for US models and almost impossible to read for each item I got a response from their support team telling me to download the all-in-one mouse driver from the website which doesn't help at all for the keyboard and headset. I am currently using last years model of the e blue mazer wired. I love it. The clickers are finally dieing which is what happens naturally. I ordered 2 wired mazer 2 models and received wireless versions.As a heavy gamer wireless is not even an option. When I contacted customer support I was not able to receive a wired version and was directed to the old mazer model. I settled for the same model and had my order on a 2 day shipping for free courtesy of amazon customer service.In short, I like e blue mazers. There is a wireless variant on this mouse, but the one I received was wired. I also noticed the default seller on the page has changed. These reviews are probably because of the change in seller. For future purchasers, the seller I bought my mouse from and received the wired version of the mouse was Bangplus, they are the highest rated of the currently 3 sellers selling this product. Hopefully this will help anyone wanting the wireless version of the mouse in the future. I wrote a driver from a base windows driver to get everything working so if you&#8217;re not computer savvy you might want to rethink buying these items. The wireless mouse will eat up your batteries if you leave the LEDs on but the worse part about the wireless mouse is shuts off every five seconds or so to reserve the battery so you have to left or right click to get the mouse going again and there is no were to shut off this option.

I'll definitely buy another mouse from E-Blue again. My only sort of issue is that I wish the mouse had more side buttons, perhaps maybe in the future if they had 9 button mouses, would be great. Other than that, great mouse! In fact, I loved it so much that I convinced my boss to get one for me instead of the crappy dell mouse I had. Would buy this many more times, even on my own dime.TLDR: Awesome, buy it. The lights were a lot brighter than I expected, and it is very noticeable in my peripheral vision.I leave my PC on throughout the night, and there is no switch to turn off the lights, so that is kind of annoying,but nothing too big of a deal.The mouse clicks well, minimal force, not loud, good for FPS/MMO(RPG)s.There is enough space for your thumb so that it wouldn't constantly hit the sensitive side buttons.I like the soft touch material.The braid cable is a lot more flexible than I expected, which is a good thing.I was contemplating on buying the wired or wireless version of this mouse, but I'm glad I chose this one.Would recommend to everyone, for web browsing or for gaming.Overall, satisfied purchase.", "qas": [{"id": 205, "question": "How loud does the mouse click?

{"context": "It would double click on a single click every once in a while, so I decided to upgrade with the same company, since I was so surprised with the quality for the price of the last mouse I ordered from them (I would also recommend the Cobra, even with the clicking problem).The first thing you'll notice about this mouse is the packaging. E-Blue is a Japanese company (products assembled in China), and all of the directions are in Japanese. That said, it's a plug and play device, and very straight forward, the only trip up you could have is what color means which setting on the DPI switch button.The LED's on this thing are awesome. my other mouse was already at its last breaths but this one right outta the box it felt right im so happy with this purchase I wrote a driver from a base windows driver to get everything working so if you&#8217;re not computer savvy you might want to rethink buying these items.

DPI button is useful, thumb rest is comfortable, mouse is a comfy material and isn't very heavy and moves smoothly, buttons and scroll wheel are all easy to use, and the 250/500Hz switch is nice.

The thumb rest is nice to have and adds stability to the mouse while the other side gives you a very nice grip. Also the lights make the mouse look very cool, but it has its downsides (Read cons for more info).Cons:With this issue, I may have gotten a defective unit, but the middle button was hard to click at times (When it worked, it worked very well).

{"context": "Pros:- DIRT CHEAP- great feel (i have larger sized hands)- custom dpi button has so many applicationsCons:- Only &#34;con&#34; is the lights stay on when my computer is in sleep mode (but this is hardly an issue) Pressing the clickers and buttons will still turn the computer back on. For web browsing and non gaming tasks, I recommend setting the delay switch on the bottom to 250hz and the DPI button to red. The higher DPI and delay settings will make the cursor move faster. It comes with 4 settings, maxing out at 2500 DPI. The button is illuminated by an LED that changes color based on the current setting (dim blue for low, red for med, blue for high, and purple for max). The mouse wheel has a nice thud to it every notch you rotate it. It's extremely comfy in my hand, although I've learned to use three fingers with my mouse since that was the only way to hold my old Cobra comfortably. This is a palm mouse, so that could be a con for some people, but that's what I prefer, even when I game. I needed a replacement for my old mouse with worn out clickers and I found this very cheap gaming mouse with good reviews. For this price, you might expect to get cheap and flimsy plastic and very inaccurate reponsiveness. But this is not the case. This is well built and comparable to a $70 gaming mouse. The only reason for the low price is that it is a Chinese Brand. But don't let that discourage you because most gaming mice are made in China anyway.The blue led lights are always on even when the computer is on standby or when its getting power from the usb ports, but the optical lens is off during standby so it wont accidentally turn the computer on when the mouse is unintentionally moved. All the buttons work great and so do the lights. Its the regular blue that I was hoping for. The cable looks extra strong as well. The feel is perfect especially when the back of your thumb falls on the wing. Very comfortable overall.My only con with this mouse is that after I shut down my PC, the light on the mouse stays on and I still haven't been able to figure out how to turn it off other than unplugging the cable every time.

{"context": "Okay I'm impressed with this product it works very well, have not had any problems with it so far. It may be a bit lighter than id like it to be but its still pretty nice. Ive actually received a wired one compared to other reviewers, just be careful and look at which buyer you buy from, I bought mines from &#34;Bangplus&#34;. No need to install anything, its just plug in and use. It's constructed very well and has nice solid weight to it. The plastic has a soft coating on it that is pleasant to touch and the LED illumination is really cool. The primary buttons and the MMB click precisely and the scroll wheel is notched and very well damped. While the DPI speed must be cycled through (whereas the MX 518 has +/- buttons), I do like that its illuminated different colors to indicate what speed its in. It also has a switch under the mouse to toggle between 250Hz and 500Hz.This is the corded model NOT the wireless model. I do a lot of CAD work and powerpoint work, so I&#8217;m always looking for precise mice. The gaming mice are the best as they are sharp and work on almost any type of surfaces. I was looking at the E-3lue E-Blue Mazer II because it answers to the challenge, but also because it&#8217;s wireless, making it portable to go to meetings when carrying a laptop.The feel is good and the 3 top buttons (2 + wheel) are sharp. First off, if you have ANY questions that you have about this mouse, please message me and I will answer it to the best of my ability.Pros:Awesome price for what you get.

{"context": "Its amazing. High quality display box. Arena and Daggerfall both come with dosbox so they are playable without the stress. Steam keys are included with Morrowind, Skyrim and Oblivion. Morrowind has four discs, one being the construction set, the other being Bloodmoon and Tribunal. Oblivion is two discs with one being the all the previous dlc. Skyrim is one disc but contains all the dlc. It came with all the maps minus Shivering isles. This is awesome...I picked this up during a lightning deal for $25 on Cyber-Monday and I couldn't be happier with the value I got here. You get a DVD for each game plus all of the expansions AND there's a Steam key inside for the 3 latest games (Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim). I was a little disappointed that the game manual are not actually included, all you get is a note saying they're all available at bethesda.com. That is the only downside, you still get the games, Steam keys and a map for each world and it all comes in a very nice box. That's right, no fiddling around with DOSbox in this set.When I first played Arena, i was very put off by the control scheme. You either use the arrow keys or click on the sides of the screen to move, and there is no mouselook. Normally, this wouldn't be so bad. However, you cannot rebind the controls ingame.Now, once I got used to the clunky controls and the relatively harsh difficulty, (I'm too ashamed to admit how many times I died in the first dungeon) I was greeted by a massive world. The PC game is terrible. The user interface is terrible. The ability to use keyboard keys during battle makes it so that you cannot function. The first 4 games are worthless! Yes they run in a DOS environment, but who cares! The graphics are sooooo poor that you can't even tell what some things are. One of the games wouldn't load ... only a black screen!! So I loaded Skyrim and was so disappointed that I just turned it off. Don't waste your money if you are playing on a PC!! Everything Elder Scrolls up until now in a neat package. You need to get a free Steam account to enjoy Skyrim, but if you do, you can download the games to your Steam account and just put in the code in the game box.

I actually already own Morrowind, Oblivion game of the year, and Skyrim Legendary Edition. So the only knew content I'd be getting is Daggerfall (which is the best because it's absolutely massive), Arena (which is great, but extremely hard), and the extra DLC and expansion packs for Morrowind (because I have the standard xbox version). My pc unfortunately cannot run Skyrim, but that's ok because I have it on ps3. Picked this up during the holiday season for my nephew, so cannot say much about the product itself since I have not played it. The 5 stars I gave is for AMAZON. A few problem came up during the shipping process to Canada and Amazon went above and beyond what I thought was fair in compensating for the inconveniences.

The price was too good to be true.When it arrived in the mail (two days early) I immediately opened it to find the holy grail of Elder Scrolls goodies. It includes all five of the games, including DLC for each of them along with Steam Codes for Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim. It also came with some awesome map posters.This is a perfect item for anyone who is a fan of the series. Absolutely epic. Starting from the outside in the box is beyond cool, I feel like I need to display this thing not put it on a shelf. In the box is the fold out display used to hold the games which is really cool; it has a full panoramic shot of each game. Next the games. All of them installed perfectly, run well, and are really fun. I feel if you're an Elder Scrolls fan you need to own this.

A Steam Key is included, and will also add Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim to your Steam account, but you can install all the games (excluding Skyrim) without Steam if desired.Since Arena and Daggerfall are available for download for free from the official Elder Scrolls website, you're only paying for Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim and all the associated expansions. While it may not be anywhere near as detailed as later games, the scope of the game and the amount of dungeons to crawl through is staggering and crawling through said dungeons is very fun. This game also has a overworld even larger than Arena's, so you might want to rethink going out to that dungeon on foot. The game is about as hard as Arena, but if you find it too difficult, you could always set the reflexes on the lowest setting.This game is equally simple to install on Windows. Just run the auto-installer and you're all set. This is nitpicking, and doesn't warrant removing a star.So, what comes in the box?DVDs for:Elder Scrolls: Arena and a DOS emulator (this game came out in 1994)Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall, also with a DOS emulator (1996)Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind with Bloodmoon and Tribunal expansions (2002)Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion with Shivering Isles and Knights of the Nine and other minor expansionsElder Scrolls V: Skyrim with Hearthfire, Dragonborn, and Dawnguard expansionsAlso included, 5 maps for the different areas of each game, but no Shivering Isles map:Skyrim (Skyrim)Cyrodil (Oblivion)Vardenfell (Morrowind)Hammerfell (Arena and Daggerfall)Tamriel (all games)A Steam account is required to activate Skyrim, even if installing from the DVD; this is not required for the other 4 games. It said when I checked this that Daggerfall had been made so it would work with newer operating systems and when I finally got around to installing it my husband spent two days and never could get it to work. My main reason for buying this was to play the one Elder Scrolls I had not ever experienced. So I will keep because it was a good price for the rest of the games. Aesthetically it is very nice looking. All dlc for all games except Skyrim so it's a nice pack for the xmas sale price I got it for but still disappointed that Daggerfall never would work with my Windows 8 Everything Elder Scrolls up until now in a neat package.

Definitely worth it.I haven't had any problem with scratched discs.

I started playing with a controller (joystick) and thats what I like now. Already had the Oblivion and Skyrim games so mostly bought this for Arena, Daggerfell, and Morrowind (which I have also played before but the disc has since gotten too scratched up to use).But I found Arena to be practically impossible to play; at least using a mouse. I had too much trouble swinging my weapon and kept getting killed; I never even made it out of the starter dungeon before I ave up in sheer disgust. Frustrating; not fun. The graphics are even more primitive than I expected, too.Daggerfell is easier to get around in, and I didn't get killed too often or too easily, but it quickly got monotonous and boring; all fight and no plot before I gave up on it too for something else (though unlike Arena i'll likely go back to it if and when I get bored).

The Anthology does a great job combining all five games with all the expansions in one package, along with the maps and an Elder Scrolls Online sticker.Still, I miss physical manuals. Oblivion's manual is one of my favorites for any game, and I don't think paying $80 should include a piece of paper that tells me to go online to find them. When I heard that there were plans to release all the Elder Scrolls games with their expanded content in one physical package, I knew that I had to purchase it.

{"context": "I got the ps3 version and had the digital download for ps4 for only 10 bucks and WOW! Amazing graphics, huge difference than the old gen consoles! Call of who? Battlefield 4, best fps hands down! Over and out As always, the gameplay is tight, the options are varied, and the size of the maps are huge. With the introduction of the PS4 & XBOX-ONE the graphics take a huge leap forward on the next-gen consoles bringing them in line with what PC gamers have been enjoying for a while now. As someone who played the first few months on PS3 and upgraded to PS4, I can tell you the difference is jaw dropping. While playing on PS3 I thought the game looked great, and it does, but when I upgraded to PS4 I was amazed the first time I played. Even though the game has some of it right; the hit detection and weapon spray is seriously flawed. Resulting in a frustrating and quickly unplayable game similar to the prior game Battlefield 3. Additionally, Battlefield: Hardline has been getting played in beta and it is no different looking regarding gun play then this game or battlefield 3.It is a pretty simple trade off with weapon mechanics in games and reality, if it kicks it has power, if it doesn't then it uses smaller rounds meaning less power. In this game it makes no difference cause everything regarding the weapon was flawed from the start, and just as an example you can shoot an enemy online standing still in front of you with a gun and it will take 5 bullets to kill, then add a attachment and it will take 6, 7 or 8 bullets to get the kill. So far I have experienced the following while playing on PS3...1. It takes an abnormally long time to connect to servers or to get into a match. Most of the time it says check my connection, even though nothing is wrong with my service or connection. If i keep trying to join, I get in eventually after about 5 minutes.2. When connecting to regular Team Deathmatch games it sometimes puts me into Squad Deathmatch games.3. Upon being revived, the game locks up. I can see/hear what is going on and it prompts me to accept the revive or spawn, but will not do anything when buttons are pressed. This continued for a week or so with regular freezing up while playing online, and at the end of the week I decided it wasn't worth the chance of frying my system for this game.

{"context": "I am a female gamer (22 years old). I play with my brother who lives on the other side of the US. I honestly LOVE BF4 and the whole battlefield series. DICE puts out WAY better games in my opinion compared to the COD series.This game has definitely been upgraded from BF3. I feel there is better graphics in the BF4 game and everything seems smoother. You get all types of weather conditions, elevator systems, buildings are destructable, plus, you can go into water and dive, drive vehicles through the water. Here you can test all of your weapons and vehicle specializations. You have a map on which you have a shooting range with targets, you have every single type of vehicle to use, you have tanks, jeeps, boats, but all of them are the US version. The map is similar to Parcel Storm. Many times I unlock a new gun but I want to test it out before using it in battle, I can go here and see how much, recoil, accuracy it has, etc.Another good thing is if you are lagging too much to the point that you can't play on online servers you can come here and it won't lag. I say it's good to have an imagination because it helps more to pretend you're shooting at frantic enemies instead of pieces of wood. Also it's always the same map, it's not a multiplayer map and you can only do the test range by yourself, all pretty big cons for the people planning to set up perfect camp spots or strategies based on what they found in the test range, but also a pretty big con for people that didn't want to have to play a test range to feel like they were matched evenly with the competition so I can understand why DICE set this mode up like thisSquad death match: Avoid at all costs unless you have at least 3 other people to play with before starting a match. Let's get this out of the way, the PS3/360 version of this game is inferior graphically to its PC and next-gen consoles. Performance wise, it's still doing 60 fps but they've had to sacrifice some textures and effects. There are textures that look worse than BF3 and some look better oddly enough. But gameplay is what matters and I have an inkling that most people picking this version up are planning on getting the PS4 version. In fact, this version is competent enough that you might as well get the extra two weeks of leveling in and then upgrade for a mere $10.There isn't much to say that hasn't been said in the other positive reviews other than to stress that this game is meant to be played on PC and next-gen.

{"context": "The multiplayer is the life and soul of the game, and lives up to and improves upon what Battlefield 3 had to offer. There's greater variety of vehicles, maps which push off into new and interesting directions with changeable elements thanks to Levolution...Yet finding a score is tricky.The single player is quite fun and even challenging on easy. Wide variety of guns and vehicles.Only reason I give it 4 out of 5 is the language. I'm not a fan of cursing and I don't think it's necessary to make a game great. My eleven year old son loves this game. I know he is a minor and I don't like the language he is hearing on the game. He hears worse at school. My husband was in the military and is a police officer and a fire arms instructor together they play this game almost everyday. They love the graphics and the campaigns. My son loves this game. He won''t put it down. It is a little violent. Great price, great value, greatbuy I haven't played the game in about two weeks because I didn't want to start all over again just to have it delete on me again. Great experience from this game. Story line keeps me in to the action. Online action is fast paced and captivating.", "qas": [{"id": 222, "question": "This game is in language or subtitles in Spanish?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 553, "text": "I know he is a minor and I don't like the language he is hearing on the game."}, {"answer_start": 349, "text": "Wide variety of guns and vehicles.Only reason I give it 4 out of 5 is the language."}, {"answer_start": 827, "text": "My son loves this game."}, {"answer_start": 1060, "text": "Great experience from this game."}, {"answer_start": 513, "text": "My eleven year old son loves this game."}]}]}
