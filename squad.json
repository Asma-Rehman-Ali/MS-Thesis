{"context": "I have bought 3 joysticks by CH Products since 1994, THEY ALL STILL WORK. I have 2 of this USB Fighterstick model. The grip and movement are natural and the buttons/switches are varied & useful. I use every one of them when playing WarBirds massively multiplayer online WWII fighter/bomber pilot game. Never a glitch, highly recommended. I did cut my own rubber pad to custom fit the handgrip base in order to raise my hand level where the use of the hat switch with my thumb is easier, it woud be nice if CH included some properly shaped pad layers with their units so that the handrest could be built up in layers to the correct height by each user (but this is really nitpicking). EDIT: Saitek recently released the X-55 Rhino, which in my opinion is an overall better device. I recommend that instead. I'll leave the rest of the review unaltered, but keep in mind that it reflects the market at the time it was written.I've been using the CH Fighterstick with DCS World for a few weeks now. I'm pleased with the stick overall, though there are a few minor issues.The good:The controls are very similar to the real controls found in the F-16 and A-10C, so binding the controls in DCS World and Falcon BMS is very straightforward. In practice, this is not an issue during gentle maneuvering, but it does take some getting used to. It is an issue during hard maneuvers, which is part of why this stick isn't very good for arcade flight games.The trigger is only one-stage, with a very short throw. This is bad for DCS A-10C, as the two-stage PAC trigger system is virtually essential to accurate gun runs in that particular sim. You can work around it by binding a key or button to PAC-1, but it doesn't feel as natural as a two-stage long-throw trigger.Conclusion:I would recommend the Fighterstick to study sim users who want an authentic controller but don't want to spend $400 on a Thrustmaster HOTAS Cougar or Warthog. So I can testify that their customer service, which at one time was top notch, has declined sharply as well.I was finally able to repair the stick myself, after following instructions from an outside forum, which involved having to disassemble the unit and rebuild it due to a large amount of backlash from a very improper fit of the pots. This is simply unacceptable in a stick of this price.I am sorry to have to write a review such as this, as CH used to be the best you could get, both in terms of quality as well as service. I recently purchased the CH Products Fighterstich USB to use in a flight simulation program and have been delighted with it. It is extremely smooth to operate and I find its programmable features both versitile, and easy to program to fit my needs.

The buttons are good, springs were good, the software is pretty good, physically it's very sturdy and it feels solid. The problems started after a few months of use. I started getting dead spots, drift and it sometimes didn't return to center in the games I played (physically it was centered, but the flight sim didn't think it was.) The bottom line is that by using pots (old style variable resistors) instead of Hall Effect sensors this joystick has a limited lifespan. When the pots wear out or get dirty it's done. I'd say 1 year of heavy use is a good estimate. You simply can't expect pots to last too long when you are constantly moving them for hours a day. They are really meant for occasional adjustment to volume and such in radios and TVs not for being hammered by continuous movement in a joystick. Hall Effect sensors don't suffer this problem because there is no physical contact between the moving parts. They use magnetic induction to determine the stick position. So, save yourself some money and get a Hall Effect joystick like the Thrustmaster T-16000M Flight Stick or go big and get an all metal one like Thrustmaster Hotas Warthog, Replica Split Throttle System. When I called tech support with a question, I spoke with someone in the states after just 2 rings, and the help I received was truly first rate.In terms of the stick's movement range, and centering, I found the springs were firm but light enough that I was able to smoothly traverse both axes and it quickly returns to center. The excellent CH Control Manger software registered smooth even travel across the entire range of movement. There is a trim wheel and a wheel you can use as a throttle if you don't pick up CH's excellent companion, the Pro Throttle, but this stick does not have a twist function, so be prepared to get pedals.

{"context": "BEWARE!! This joystick DOES NOT have \"twist\" capabilities, even though the description says \"3-axis.\" The three axes they're talking about are ailerons, elevator, and throttle -- NO RUDDER CONTROL!! I didn't realize this, and so I sent it back as soon as I received it and found out that there was no rudder control... How they can call this a Fighterstick is beyond me... No rudder control? Really? Sent it back... Buying something else, and making darn sure it has rudder control on it... It does not have a rudder twist. I rather like this, as it makes the x and y axis more precise. If the rudder is deal breaker for you, then I suggest you reconsider.

The design may be a bit aged but this product is of high quality.Observations:At first the stick seems rather bulky and plastic, but the large base ensures it doesn't shift even with large control inputs, and the plastic construction is actually very sturdy. Relatively light control pressure is required and there is a distinct feel between actuating the stick on X or Y axis, but neither detract from the experience once you get use to it.

In particular, the weapon pickle button required stretching to reach.The throttle wheel is not very good as a throttle.

It hasn't been updated for Windows Vista or Windows 7. This is the classic Reader Rabbit... and I have not found a new product of similar value. We used RR with our first three children, and now that our &#34;bonus baby&#34; is four, we ordered a new copy.

I'm running OS X 10.7.5 but get a pop up that says: You can't open the application Learn To Read With Phonics because PowerPC applications are no longer supported.

This isn't a huge issue for me since I like playing RPGs and Adventure games more than fighting games. We do not own a game console (xbox, wii or such) as we find that the kids already spend enough time on the computer. However, my son had recently gotten into role playing games like Titan Quest and Eragon. Using the keys to move was frustrating him. These work perfectly. In fact the 10 year old \"installed\" them himself and was playing both games with his 8 year old sister minutes later. They are quite well built for the price and seem to be comfortable for the kids and my husband as well. The two center buttons (9 and 10) should be toward the lower side of the gamepad, instead of the top, where they are harder to reach.3. While this gamepad works OK with games on my Mac without extra software, Logitech's website seems to offer software for Windows only... If you have a Mac and you want to assign key combinations to the controller, or configure it for use with Finder or other apps, you'll have to install a third-party program.Some points of advice for shoppers:1. Works fine with Lego StarWars 2 but no control at all of Lego StarWars 1. Good inexpensive controller for kids. The controller is solid. It has a nice grip, has 8 programmable buttons, and the d-pad has 360 degree rotation, which is a big plus when you're trying to move around when playing a game. Another big plus is this controller is literally plug and play--no cd installing is required. You just plug it in your USB port and play away. The only drawback I can see is possibly at least 2 more buttons (especially when it comes to emulation and the latest sports game).

{"context": "I first got these to play my Nintendo and SNES games in emulation software on my laptop that runs Windows Vista. The plug and play simplicity of these controllers was great and they worked wonderfully.When I tried to use them on my Windows 7 desktop, however, the computer wouldn't recognize the devices. But, fear not, it turns out that if you go to Microsoft.com there is a Logitech driver available for free download and the controllers work fine once again. This item is useless. It isn't compatible with most the games I have and doesn't work the way a controller should work. Often, some of the buttons can't be assigned an action and since most games require duel joysticks, you can't never look around with this controller. AHHHH!! !

{"context": "There is no need to use HDMI as the XBox 360 lacks a blu ray player & this is a high quality set of component cables at a great price. I hooked mine straight to the T.V and than ran HDMI out to my receiver for sound. Great picture & sound quality with no flicker or delay. Noticed the difference between these cords and the factory composite cords in both games & movies.Only con I can see is the length could be problematic for those with mounted flat screens as you'll need to keep the XBox somewhat close to your set. The reason its 2 stars and not 3 stars is because it costs more than the regular component cable, so you should get more for what you pay for. This is my review and doesn't work as well as you want it to. Get the Microsoft one or the Madcatz one. Not only were these wires hard to fit into my 32inch Panasonic T.V they were even harder to pull out. When I tried to twist and pull off the monster cable the cable itself broke and even damaged my new hd television port. The cables were made very poorly though Iam sure they work well based on other reviews. This was the biggest waste of money ever. As a result you are forced to spend 45-70 dollars on the AV cable and then another 25-35 on a fiber optic cable. In my case I already had several THX 1000 cables that I planned on using with my 360 and now I am forced to spend more money on a THX 400 or below just to get the adapter. As a huge monster cable fan I am extremely disappointed with the company's decision to package the product in this manner. Shame on Monster cables!

Easy to install, great color options, and very durable. The description and picture matched perfectly to the item I received. Pros: These packs are the perfect way to charge your wii controllers without having to take out the batteries every time like with rechargeable AA batteries. The design of the grip is also a nice addition; comfortable, but not hampering like some of the skins that Nintendo makes.Cons: If you use these battery packs, you have to use the included back part that goes on the actual controller. This is annoying because I already have skins that I previously used for the controllers that now have become useless. That is another point, you cannot use any skins with these battery packs unless you want to take them off each time you want to charge them. This was so inexpensive and a definite necessity for the Wii. We went through so many AA batteries for the remotes and now we can just plug them into the charger and they are ready for the next time. One of the original batteries that came with the Nyko charger finally went dead and the other was getting close after many years of use. Didn't really need the new covers, but my daughter was happy that a pink one came with the order. Reasonable price considering how long the originals lasted and how much use we got out of them.

{"context": "I got the Nyko twin pack battery/charger plus one extra battery, since we have 3 kids and 3 Wii remotes.Pros:* Charging dock has built-in AC supply, so no clunky wall wart adapter to find a home for - just plug the dock into a convenient AC socket. * Dock doesn't get warm (either while or while not charging batteries) which is unusual for cheap consumer electronic devices. * Battery and cover are a perfect fit into the Wii remote. * Comes with NiMH batteries (rather than the cheaper NiCd) so they should last a long time despite not being given 'good charging etiquette'. This Nyko Wii Battery Kit is great if you already have theWii Charge Stationbase. The base (sold separately) comes with two of these battery kits plus the base. Since the Wii can use FOUR Wiimotes, you'll need two additional batteries, and this Battery Kit fits the bill very well.The batteries hold their charge quite well and for a long time. They also don't take TOO long to charge up.Unfortunately, you can't set the batteries in the charger by themselves: They have to be attached to a Wiimote. I already have the dual charge base, but have four controllers. I didn't have room for another charge base, so buying the extra batteries, plus backs (because you can't use the jackets with these batteries). The backs have an opening to allow the charge base to charge the batteries. Also they have a rubbery coating that supplies a sure grip on the controller, but is way better than using the jackets that come with the controllers.I really like the convenience of this type of setup. My 20 year old son received this item plus another cheaper version. Apparently the battery grip is quite comfortable and he prefers this item over the other. When I went to use my Wii the other day, I realized that the batteries had all gone bad on the remotes. I ordered these replacement batteries and they work exactly as promised.

I took a gamble but in my case I think it payed off.Also for anyone wondering if this yoke works with a mac don't worry. I hooked the yoke up to my mac and am running xplane ver.9.

{"context": "Well I just did some research on this yoke and discovered that Sietek has resolved the phantom keystroke issue. New replacement units are shipping to all US distributers. If you happen to have a defective unit, per a post on Sietek's forum, owners are to call 310-972-9930 for return/replacement instructions. I am going to order one myself but am not sure if Amozon has the new units yet. Sietec refused to post a current serial number of the defective lot but a person on the forums said that he just got his and is working flawlessly with a serial number of SZ005111624. I bought this to replace my aging CH Yoke. I find it to be far superior in both feel and accuracy. Separating the throttle is a nice touch (I bought a second one for my twin props.) My experience In FSX so far has been excellent. There are no phantom key presses that I kept hearing about. The only thing I really miss from my CH Yoke is the mechanical trim which is the only reason I'm not giving this item 5 stars. As a private pilot, I fly sims to keep current with procedures. When it was time to replace my CH yoke/rudder, I'd hear about Saitek and decided to give them a try.The order came in quickly and I was pleasantly surprised at the construction. It seemed better built than the CH product line. The first issue I encountered was the height required to secure the yoke. I have a desk with a retractable keyboard drawer. The Saitek mounting hardware extends about 5\" below the desk, which forces me remove the keyboard drawer to use the yoke. I was initially hesitant about purchasing this product mainly because of all the Phantom Keypress issues I've been reading about. Besides, my CH Products Yoke seemed to be serving me just fine.Well, it appears Saitek has resolved the Phantom Keypress issue, and as such they have a winner on their hands. This product has definately upped the realism of my Flight Sim experience. It is solid, well built, and has plenty of key and buttons to assign when you set it up with FS9 (or FSX).What I really like about this product is the fact that the throttle/Prop/Mixture controls are separate from the yoke. Hello, I got this to replace my CH yoke and like it a lot. First thing I noticed is how well built it is. It was simple to set up. Gives me a more 'realistic' feeling than the CH yoke. Also, the price seemed reasonable when I purchased it, as it was under $90.

{"context": "I don't blame Saitek for this but I bring it up because I choose to upgrade to the Saitek Cessna Yoke. The Cessna yoke is more expensive but it is well worth it. I find it much smoother and the four way rocker on the left yoke handle is very useful, the pro flight one does not have that. Also, the feel of the Cessna throttles is superior to what I had on the pro flight model and the Cessna yoke turns a full 90 degrees. Much easier to control to ailerons.If you can afford it I recommend that you check out the Cessna version right here on Amazon. In their defense, I also own the Cessna version, while it is not all that smooth either, it is far better than this one was. I sent this one back and will just float my Cessna yoke from place to place. If you have the spare cash, I like the Cessna version, if you don't my old CH yoke was much smoother if you don't mind the toy like appearance. A Cessna 172 is sluggish and then over compensates when banking in real life, and if you have ever flown a 172, you know that you need to feel the aircraft to make much more accurate maneuvers, this yoke is very accurate except for the turning radius of the yoke (Cessna actually turn further than this yoke does). When using the yoke to fly or land a Beech twin, or a King Air 500, or even a Cessna 410, the yoke is exactly as responsive as when you are in the real plane. I researched the Pro flight against several others including CH Products flight yoke. This process consumed more than 2 months. So why did I purchase this yoke over the others?

{"context": "As an instrument rated private pilot, I have used all versions of Microsoft FS to \"practice\" instrument flying, including the most current FSX. I have use a joystick for years, but was looking to add a little more realism to my sim experience. What a mistake I made buying the Saitek yoke. It has been a very frustrating several weeks. First of all, looks can be deceiving. This yoke looks awesome on the outside, but I ditto the comments of another reviewer regarding the DETENTS in the PITCH and AILERON AXIS! I purchased the Saitek Pro Flight Yoke, Power supply for the yoke, PRO Flight Switch Panel, and the Pro Flight Instrument Panel. I installed them in the order: Yoke, switch panel, and finally the instrument panel. All the accessories are connected to the yoke. I have everything working on a Windows 7 64 bit system I built. It is running an Intel i7-970 processor, 12 GB memory, 1Gb video, and a velociraptor 300GB drive system drive/mirrored 2Gb data drives. I'm flying with MS FSX. I got my private pilot license about 6 years ago and suffer from the fairly common complaint that I simply don't have enough time (or cash) to get up as often as I need to.When I was training for my license I purchased the CH Yoke and found that it was OK for practicing some of my maneuvers but it tended to \"stick\" quite a bit which made the experience somewhat awkward and translated to rather harsher performance in my real planes.Now, half a decade or so later, I am starting to get ready for my instrument rating and I purchased this Saitek offering (and the rudder pedals) along with Flight Simulator X to both keep my habits fresh and to eventually practice procedures when in IMC. As a private pilot who flies mostly Cessna 172's, I was looking for a game and flight control system that resembled the real deal to keep current on flying techniques. The throttle quadrant works very well. The yoke also works well. My complaints are that the clamps are plastic and I'm worried about breaking and that very slight movements appear unresponsive. It is close enough for me to get this practice in and is definitely a great product if you are not a real pilot just looking to play with some simulators. I've used the yolk for both Microsoft FSX as well as Instrument Pilot Trainer 7.0. I researched the Pro flight against several others including CH Products flight yoke.

I read the reviews extensively before purchasing this Saitek flight yoke and decided to buy the cheaper of the two I was considering. The product felt sturdy out of the box and was ready to play once plugged into the computer. All the buttons functioned nicely.However, I have to say that it's MUCH easier to fly a real plane than trying to control the simulated counterpart using this flight yoke. I calibrated, recalibrated, messed with sensitivity and null zones until I was blue in the face. I couldn't get the ailerons to roll realistically, and the the pitch was waaay too touchy. When operating this yoke with my left hand, and working the throttle with my right, it's very difficult to make precise elevator control inputs because the yoke has a tendency to stick. Applying additional force will eventually move the yoke, but then it jumps, and you get too much control input. Very annoying. The yoke shaft is metal, and it is rubbing against a plastic sleeve. This inherently creates a lot of friction. It is impossible to move the yoke back and forth smoothly with one hand. Really poor design.Also the springs are too stiff. This reduced the tendency to over control. I have seen electric trim in some light planes positioned on the yoke. I have set the tree two way switches as my trim. Initially I had the \"repeat\" slider set to full and found it very difficult to precisely trim. I have backed it off to the middle setting and it is better but still easy to over trim. I believe that taking \"repeat\" off completely will be best.The quadrant movement was likewise smooth and precise. I found the zero detent very obvious, it takes very little effort to move past it, but you will know when you did. That made landing on narrow gravel strips very difficult. This one-sided dead zone is in the hardware; no software calibration can eliminate it. Setting the ailerons axis sensitivity to maximum and the null zone to zero in my Flight Simulator X did not help. The elevator control of the Saitek yoke sticks. I put a dab of soy oil lub on the shaft but it didn't make any difference. The detached quadrant with programmable buttons is a good design.

{"context": "A lot of &#34;freeplay&#34; in the yoke. Yoke moves about 8-10 mm in both axis before movement shows up on screen. Not very precise. A waste of money. In order to enjoy this program you need to buy the Flight Yoke and throttle controls using the keyboard is difficult and not much fun. I also bought the rudder pedals, but it is going to take some time for me to get it all working together, I'm a beginner so the yoke and throttle is enough for now.If you are thinking of some day flying a plane this is the package to get. If you just want jump in and just start flying get something easier. Also USB extensions over 8 feet without an amp should not be used because I had problems with a 10 foot extension cable turning the yoke on and off.Good luck and happy flying.

To consolidate the need to individually attach two devices to the desk, I combined the quad to yoke with velcro. Works very nicely. I like the ability to program the throttle quad to the aircraft I want to fly. Numerout switches on the yoke and quad allow for programming almost all functions that are needed in a flight sim. The software that comes with the unit provides total functionality in programming, because there are several &#34;modes&#34; that can be programmed with software, then selected on the yoke while flying. There are 2 mounting options for the throttle. **For FSX make sure you adjust the sensitivity for the throttles or you wont get the full range. The sensitivity should be all the way up and null zone all the way down** Unfortunately unlike a stick like the X-52 you don't have a rudder axis on the yoke so you will still need some way to use the rudder if you dont have pedals yet. The rudder axis can be mapped to a axis on the throttle quadrant but who wants to lose that axis to the rudder.I haven't had any issues with anything, it all worked right out of the box and was up and running in minutes.

{"context": "I gave this 5 stars as the Rock Band Drum set is great. However, getting it on time and in decent condition was NOT great. I paid for one day shipping and didn't receive it as promised. I emailed Amazon and they said it would be there by the 24th of Dec. That's fine, but I paid for one-day service, which didn't happen. When I got the drum set it was delivered by a plain white van -- not Federal Express -- and the box was wet, damaged and falling apart. The game is really fun to play with the family. I play drums along with my wife, my 8 year old son plays guitar, and my 5 1/2 year old daughter sings. It is truly a different game for the whole family to enjoy. This is my second drum set since my first set got fried from lightening hitting the house. The family wanted to keep playing and singing so I bought another drum set. Go get you this game! Designed to fail? Must be! Just short of 50 days use and the drums (yellow the worst, then red) do not register the hits. Warrenty is 60 days from date of purchase. Thats a lousy warrenty! It's saying \"we know it is going to fail, and fail fast\"! I bought the Rock Band set in early December, as a Xmas gift for my kids (who are only here every other weekend) and by Feb. 14 the drums are totally unresponsive. So maybe 2 weeks of use total, between the kids and me. This drum set works perfectly great! Compared to the Rock Band 2 drums these work perfectly the same. The only downfall that comes with the set is that the pedal is horrendous to use. Unless you've been playing rock band for a while or the drums itself, your feet will get fatigued very fast. It's much more difficult to do songs with lots of bass pedal. But that can be fixed by just buying a new rock band 2 pedal or any other pedal. If you're EL drums are being finicky about registering notes, you can return them for a new set:[...]A lot of people are modding the drum heads with mute pads, everything from using Staples round mouse pads glued to the rock band pads with rubber cement to towels to socks to companies like rockbandrumsoft.com that sell peel and stick gum rubber (what professionals use) to neoprene and urethane.

Since I would actually prefer to hit a little harder (I didn't know if the Rock Band drums were designed to hold up to real pounding) the pads should be a great dampening tool.There is indeed a clackety-clackety sound to the set instead of the thump-thump most of us would prefer to hear, so muting the heads should help.", "qas": [{"id": 52, "question": "can you use theese with rock band 5", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "I gave this 5 stars as the Rock Band Drum set is great."}, {"answer_start": 1760, "text": "If you're EL drums are being finicky about registering notes, you can return them for a new set:[...]A lot of people are modding the drum heads with mute pads, everything from using Staples round mouse pads glued to the rock band pads with rubber cement to towels to socks to companies like rockbandrumsoft.com that sell peel and stick gum rubber (what professionals use) to neoprene and urethane."}, {"answer_start": 1361, "text": "Compared to the Rock Band 2 drums these work perfectly the same."}, {"answer_start": 1679, "text": "But that can be fixed by just buying a new rock band 2 pedal or any other pedal."}, {"answer_start": 1508, "text": "Unless you've been playing rock band for a while or the drums itself, your feet will get fatigued very fast."}]}]}

However, tightening this screw made everything ok.May of 2009 and the green drum pad started registering hits very sporadically.

Basically you create and control people. You run every aspect of their lives. You make them do their bidding, and if that means building a house full of nothing but wooden furniture and fireplaces, then by gum, you can do that! \"Sims 2\" is a massive improvement over the original game.

If your computer cannot take DVDs, the game simply will not start. I had played the different Sims games on the PS2 gaming consoles, but it is so much more fun on the PC.

I also love the fact that you can purchase different vehicles. This game is very addictive. I played everyday for three weeks straight. Be prepared to get immersed in the stories. The only complaint I have is that there are only two body types available. You won't even feel the need to buy the other expansions.

{"context": "Lots of reviews to tell you about gameplay. I just want to add that my four kids all love this game. Two boys who usually spend their time on COD4 and two girls who usually have no use for computer games. I came home last night and all four were gathered around the monitor discussing how their various \"families\" were interacting.All games can teach logic to some degree - but I think that Sims teach several lines of logic as well as gameplay theory without ever bringing the subject up... with school age kids - how sweet is that!!! I ordered this for my daughters. Our oldest (12) has been playing it at a friends house and has been asking for her own copy for a couple of months. It is easy to set up, the graphics are very nice, and the game play is virtually limitless. *Warning* your kids will get sucked into it and lose countless hours glued to the computer. We have enforced time limits for our kids. Also, part of the game play does involve the characters having sex. It seems that's the only aspect of the game that my 12 year old daughter is interested in. The sims 2 double deluxe game is AMAZING. Its just like real life!you can........*have kids*get married*get a good job*host parties*get a maid, butler gardener etc. * make your own uniqe family*make a neighborhoodthis game is everything i hoped for!!!! I have one problem with this game though. It does not work on all PC'S. It works on mine just fine but i know some people that had alot of trouble with it. One of my kids is addicted to this. Is that good? I'm not sure. In terms of the number of starts, I'm rating it as I think my kid would. I love this game! I play it twice a day! it is soooooooo addicting! perfect for teens NOT for kids under 13 or 14. I really love this a lot because i am the controller! I make the characters! I make the town! it is awesome! i control them to! The only thing that really bothers me is They speak a fake language and so u have no idea what they r saying! I just wish they spoke English!", "qas": [{"id": 63, "question": "can you have kids in this", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1480, "text": "One of my kids is addicted to this."}, {"answer_start": 869, "text": "We have enforced time limits for our kids."}, {"answer_start": 1685, "text": "perfect for teens NOT for kids under 13 or 14."}, {"answer_start": 44, "text": "I just want to add that my four kids all love this game."}, {"answer_start": 777, "text": "*Warning* your kids will get sucked into it and lose countless hours glued to the computer."}]}]}

{"context": "Easy macros (extremely useful for MMO gamers and for power users)Cons:1. No mechanical keys (but keys still have a nice feel to them)2. No anti-ghosting (mainly impacts FPS gamers)3. No rear height adjustment (a #2 pencil fixed this for me)I really wish that Razor/Microsoft/Logitech would make a keyboard that had all of the features of this keyboard, but fixed the ghosting problem and use mechanical keys. Until they do, I believe this keyboard is one of the best for anyone who is not a heavy FPS gamer. First let me say that I'm always a little hesitant to review Microsoft products and not give them a favourable rating as a knee-jerk due to the large amount of MS Shills and MS Stooges that patrol these pages voting negative on anything that's not 5 stars. These companies are always getting in trouble for this and Belkin is currently in the news for just this kind of thing ... and right here on Amazon.So ... without further gilding the lily ...I have to say that the product was ... far ... from what I expected.As soon as I took the keyboard out of its Rubik's Cube like packaging that it came in, I began to scratch my head and furrow my brow.I'm no stranger to the many different Gaming Keyboards / Keypads that are on the market. My old keyboard had broken from rough use and I needed a new one badly. I was directed to this particular model by a friend and I couldn't be more pleased. The red back light is adjustable and is surprisingly bright. Easy to install and set up and the mappable macro keys are just awesome and easy to use. One thing that is kind of annoying is the volume knob, you have to turn it slowly up or down to reach your desired volume otherwise it will go either to the maximum or minimum depending on the direction you were turning it. Hello,This keyboard might be the best looking keyboard in the market but is it the best gaming keyboard ? absolutely NOT !!! Not even close !!!! This keyboard suffers from a ghosting problem. Not only with ctrl+w+r but with other combinations too. I have much cheaper keyboards that doesn't have a single ghosting problem and this one got plenty... I was wondering why Microsoft did not withdraw all the keyboards and instead on solving the problem with a new keyboard \"X4 and cheaper too???!??!\" and i'm not feeling comfortable remapping keys to ESDF to be able to reload while moving forward+crouching.If ghosting is not a problem for you, go for it.If ghosting will be an issue, forget about this keyboard. don't waste your money.I just gave it 2 stars because of its looks and the switchable keypad, otherwise I would have gave it 1.", "qas": [{"id": 66, "question": "Ghosting Does anybody know if this keyboard has anti-ghosting?

{"context": "Specifically, if you have a game (like FFXIV:ARR) that requires you to often hit the start or select buttons, I find that I often end up hitting the more raised buttons just above them. Even just grazing those buttons will cause the XMB to pop up, which is highly disrupting during gameplay.Another downside to the keypad is sadly a consequence of one of its better features: The keypad falls asleep and powers off after some time and comes back on when you press a button, but you have to wait for it to start up whenever that happens. I really wanted to like this product because it was made specifically by Sony to use on their PlayStation controllers so I bought it thinking it would be the best option. After a couple of uses, this product feels very awkward when using it with the PlayStation controller. The key board covers the front portion of the controller and even gives you a PS button to use but your hands would have to be huge to reach over the top portion of your regular controller in order to type anything at all. I ended up typing very slowly and awkwardly with my two index fingers the times that I did use it. Surprisingly, the feature works smoothly over the buttons. Its easy to connect, and the battery seems to last forever. If you're planning on any wireless playstation keypad, its not doubt that this is the one you should get you're hands on. Everything about this device is flawless. Its almost a guarantee you will be satisfied. Especially if you're doing a lot of PSN messaging n' stuff. The wireless keypad for the PS3 system allows you to send text messages to others on PSN by using a keypad..Works well but the downside is the buttons are WAY TOO SMALL in my opinion..

{"context": "I purchased this for use with FFXI, however the PS3 cannot use bluetooth accessories with PS2 emulated games, making this device worthless for me! Didn't know this until it was too late. I would really love it if it would work; the design is great and seems to be made well, but with this shortcoming, I have no use for it. The device is very small in size and not of much benefit. Apps like youtube won't even support this device and i mostly use it for sending messages to friends on psn. The keyboard it's so helpful with typing and browsing since the entire keys with a press of a button become a Mouse pad, for browsing on PS3; same concept as using the mouse pad on a notebook with a lil difference that the surface its not smooth but get used to it in matter of sec/min.I do have to make a point I desided to write a review here for. One of the reasons it's because I strongly believe people who sell a item and try to be so sneaky with shipping and handling are scammers and I won't support people who are dis/honest. Basically you hit the 'finger' button, and swipe your finger across the keyboard buttons, and it will control things like your home page and mouse cursor if applicable. It's a cool feature, but sometimes it sends your mouse or whatever you're doing haywire, very unreliable. Also, I couldn't really play fighting games like Marvel vs Capcom with this. It somewhat obstructs the R1 and L1 buttons, but that could just be me and my fat fingers.Pros:- Great deal for $20- Speeds up typing for things like MMROPGS or those really long messages- Easy to attach to your PS3 controller- Very familiar QWERTY format- Battery life is great- Auto-off featureCons:- Touch scrolling feature very finicky and unreliable, but cool when it works.- Slightly obstructs things like R1 and L1 (I couldn't play fighting games with this on...)- Takes quite abit of time to get used to, especially when typing symbols.Overall, it's a great addition to any PS3 user who types a lot, and I highly recommend it for any PS3 user if you have a spare $20 laying around. Going against my best judgment, I started playing some interactive games on PS3 only to understand that a keyboard was a necessity for group game playing. After some research and hearing from other gamers about using the PS3 wireless keypad, to keep up with communication within a game, I finally purchased this keypad from Amazon.I had no prior idea of the physical size of the device until I was surprised to see it arrive in a very small box.

{"context": "I bought this with the sole intention of using it for Final Fantasy XIV Online, however it only lets you type one key at a time and pause nearly 5 seconds between keystrokes making it nearly impossible to use. It does work well with other applications such as the Playstation store or messenger. Fits the controller well and isn't very heavy at all. Most would be better off with a regular USB keyboard for the same price. Before Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn came out, I wanted to make sure I had something I could use to easily type into my PS3 at a moment's notice.

This thing is blu tooth and most importantly is rechargeable via USB same as your PS3 controller. Also you will have no trouble syncing it to your PS3...It does it automatically when you turn the device on and start typing. I gave it a 3 star rating only because the keys do not light up. If it did, it would be GREAT!!! !NOTE: Trouble Shooting Tip: When the battery is low or the device is out of sync, it will flash red and green lights on the device. The letters, numeric and punctuation keys are where you would expect them to be but the special keys are not exactly at their familiar places and some of the less essential ones (PgUp, PgDn, End, Home and the function keys) are missing. Special characters can be entered with the help of 2 modifier keys (the Blue and the Orange).Three special keys allow you to enable the touch pad mode or quickly jump to your PS3 message box or friends list icons - I did not find the last 2 very useful.Until you make yourself familiar with some of the less obvious key combinations it's a good idea to save the instructions pamphlet (a 17\"x11\" folded sheet) found in the package.The touch pad mode is very interesting in that, after pressing the 'touch pad key', the keyboard is disabled and a section of the keyboard emulates a laptop's touch pad and the 2 cursor keys emulate mouse buttons and you can interact with your environment as if you were using a mouse.I am a 'knob' person as far as mouse emulation is concerned but, based on my testing, the touch pad mode, while interesting and innovative, is not very well implemented.
