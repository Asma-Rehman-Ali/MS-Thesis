{"context": "The Pro-pedals, dont work with many games, but they r the only pedals that have oppistite sliding &quot;action&quot;, and i cant get them 2 work with any of the flight sims i have (alot) and they cost,alot but there the closest pedals 2 the real thing, and i got them 2 years ago for christmas and pulled them out of my closet yesterday, and plugged them into the USB port, and When u do that a window should pop up and say &quot;new software detected&quot; but it didnt then my dad and i had 2 go 2 CH.com and install a ton of drivers, and yet none of them worked. I have a new Gateway 1.8 GHz computer, with 512 MB of RAM and my older Flightstick Pro was reluctant to work with the new machine, although it and the Pro Pedals both worked fine on the old AMD K6 (350)with Jane's WWII Fighters and other games.So, I ordered a new pair of CH Pro Rudder Pedals for USB port connectors. Also a new Flightstick Pro USB. The Flightstick immediately worked fine, but Jane's WWII Fighters does not support the USB rudder pedals. Unfortunate, because in my opinion Jane's is the best simulator game around. Works great like every other CH products item I've had !Only regret was to retire my CH game port version in order to start using this USB version.. old set still working fine after so many years.Windows XP forced the need to upgrade to USB however.Anything better built cost three times as much.Update: 8/08/2007 Still working just fine and no need to want better. Using these pedals with FS2004, I found that the rudder controls work quite nicely but the toebrakes are just too sensitive. CH Products has some software that will moderate pedal movement to soften the touchiness, but their customer service is very unprofessional, almost as if an 8 year old is telling you what to do. Given the FS2004 market, I'd guess that CH Products would take this issue more seriously. Bottom Line, there are not too many choices for \"real\" flight pedals unless you can build them yourself. I think besides Saitech's, these are it.I have used these pedals extensively for IL2, and have not had a problem with them yet.These pedals:1) Install easily on XP2) Have a 7' cord giving you ample length to hook them up3) Have a solid base (you may need to add some gripping rubber to hold them in place)4) Large pedals to accommodate large feet and shoes5) Enough weight and resistance to avoid jerky movements5) Brake function6) AccuracyNot sure what else you need.They could have even more resistance and smoother glide, I guess, but that would be extra frosting on a pretty nice cake.For a flight sim I would recommend you get, in this order:1) A good quality joystick2) Track IR3) These PedalsNow, that ends up being around $300 or so all told, but if you are serious about your sim, it will be worth it.", "qas": [{"id": 0, "question": "Can I use these with Window 8/8.1?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 566, "text": "I have a new Gateway 1.8 GHz computer, with 512 MB of RAM and my older Flightstick Pro was reluctant to work with the new machine, although it and the Pro Pedals both worked fine on the old AMD K6 (350)with Jane's WWII Fighters and other games.So, I ordered a new pair of CH Pro Rudder Pedals for USB port connectors."}, {"answer_start": 1980, "text": "I think besides Saitech's, these are it.I have used these pedals extensively for IL2, and have not had a problem with them yet.These pedals:1) Install easily on XP2) Have a 7' cord giving you ample length to hook them up3) Have a solid base (you may need to add some gripping rubber to hold them in place)4) Large pedals to accommodate large feet and shoes5) Enough weight and resistance to avoid jerky movements5) Brake function6) AccuracyNot sure what else you need.They could have even more resistance and smoother glide, I guess, but that would be extra frosting on a pretty nice cake.For a flight sim I would recommend you get, in this order:1) A good quality joystick2) Track IR3) These PedalsNow, that ends up being around $300 or so all told, but if you are serious about your sim, it will be worth it."}, {"answer_start": 1465, "text": "Using these pedals with FS2004, I found that the rudder controls work quite nicely but the toebrakes are just too sensitive."}, {"answer_start": 1590, "text": "CH Products has some software that will moderate pedal movement to soften the touchiness, but their customer service is very unprofessional, almost as if an 8 year old is telling you what to do."}, {"answer_start": 1099, "text": "Works great like every other CH products item I've had !Only regret was to retire my CH game port version in order to start using this USB version.. old set still working fine after so many years.Windows XP forced the need to upgrade to USB however.Anything better built cost three times as much.Update: 8/08/2007 Still working just fine and no need to want better."}]}]}
{"context": "I was having problems with my Logitech Momo racing controler. The wheel is great but the pedals kept losing calibration. From reading various racing sim forums I sensed lots of people were having the same problem. Trying to repair the pedals with new pots and all of the tweaks available was fruitless. I installed the USB CH Pro Pedals along with the Momo wheel and now have the perfect system. In GPL, F1 Challenge, GTR, GTR2 and Nascar 2003it works better than I could ask. I can not get the combination to work in RB Rally, but I'll pass on that for the great driving control I get in the other sims.Jim I am an amatuer with this stuff, but believe me these pedals sure made me feel like a professional. Just plug them in, take off and fly. I am very happy with the quality of this product. I must also say how impressed I am with Amazon's service form the time of order and with-in a few days having the product arrive.I also like to play with my NASCAR racing game and these pedals also work excellent with that. I always heard that CH Products were good and now I know why. I got into the CH hardware after my trusty TM F-22/TQS/RCS set up got to the point where it was too old and battered to be able to keep working correctly. I started with the Fighterstick and the Pro Throttle and within a week had placed my order for the pedals. So far they have worked well and withstood the effects of damp shoes, cats, dust, and so on. I have used them in Aces High 2 and the previous incarnation of Microsoft's Flight Sim and when combined with the CH yoke these pedals have also acted as racing controls in GTA2 and I have been extremely happy with them. The sliding around issue could probably be fixed by mounting the system to something heavy or perhaps using Velcro to fix it to the carpet. Also I suppose one could hacksaw off the heel cups.. But I don't think there's a fix for the lack of spring to center forces... Honestly, if I could afford them, I'd rather own the Cirrus Rudder Pedals, but their also 5x the cost so... I eagerly anticipate the day where we can have pedals at a reasonable cost, and with solid (and realistic) performance The software also wraps all of the CH Products into one joystick if needed, because many games only support one joystick.The spring tension is fine, and does not cause fatigue. It also recenters to zero fine.I am using this for Star Citizen, and having full rudders takes some getting used too, but my precision is far better than having it in a joystick twist. It is also less fatigue on the hand.

{"context": "For us guys flying the smaller types of General Aviation aeroplanes like e.g. Piper PA28 and Cessna 172, the pedals are not so realistic. This is because in such aeroplanes, your heels are placed on the floor, and not on the pedals. In the real world, only the frontmost part of the foot is placed on the pedals for rudder control during flight. The Pro Pedals require the whole foot to be placed on (or actually \"in\") the pedal, which gives an awkward non-realistic non-relaxed feeling.But once you have gotten used to this, the pedals work very well.My pedals came with an irritating error, though. Consider IL-2 again. It supports the first four controllers as sorted by Windows. If you have a yoke, pedals, flight stick, throttle, trim wheels, throttle quadrants, etc., then it requires plugging and unplugging of the controllers depending on the types of planes you want to fly. You also have to restart your game and reconfigure the axis settings each time you switch. I was able to eliminate all that by Ch Products' software. I just consolidated all my Ch Products gear into a smaller number of controllers, and then I able to fairly easily use the controls I wanted with the planes I wanted--and it took a fraction of a time to change.I have never used the Saitek pedals myself, so if you're wondering which you should buy, I can only say that you'll likely find them more comfortable because of the distance between the pedals, but you'll also find them less functional because the Saitek software (although quite good and easy to learn and use) just can't approach what the Ch Products Control Manager can do.If the Ch Products pedals were farther apart, I'd rate this 5 out of 5 stars. I don't want to twist my joystick that is already controlling my pitch and rotation. The separated axes allow for more precision--even if it's done with my clumsy feet.My biggest complaint about these pedals is they're not comfortable for prolonged use because they're too close together, and being a guy, I don't normally have my feet that close together for extended periods of time. I ended up building my own custom set of pedals, and I roughly doubled the distance of the Ch Products pedals. I find that to be much more comfortable. I have had mine a long time and they have served me well. The only problem can be with the short distance between pedals. I have been using the CH Pro Pedals for nearly a year without any problems at all. I also use the CH Pro Throttle and CH Fighterstick for my HOTAS set up and they all work great together. I fly IL2 Sturmovik 1946 and my CH set up works great for this game.

{"context": "You must adjust the rollers in tooth of each foot by one tooth. This will give you the play you need to give you the dimmer switch jiggle before activation for bright lights in a car. The other way is to try and get the Windows sensitivity to slow this down by adjusting this play there. Slowing sensitivity may not stop activation just pressure on this. The experimentation may be your best bet on this. Ask the service folks at CH if you do not feel comfortable with the pedal adjustment I made. The unit feels just like the real thing then. A large sheet so I could later move the pedals around to different positions on the board.I use this setup: Fighterstick USB, ThrottlePro USB, Pro Rudder Pedals USB, all CH branded. All 3 of these combine with CH's software to make one huge virtual device. So if you then go to Windows control panel's game control applet you see 1 device not 3. That one device has six axis and 32 buttons! Never calibrate it there (doing that will screw it all up). Instead ONLY calibrate it in the CH software.I assigned those six axes to: 1 HorizStickX 2 VertStickY 3 Wheel on the stick (Fuel mixture lean/rich), 4 Throttle, 5 Right brake, 6 Left brake. I do not understand how this product contiues to get such great reviews. I fly small general aviation aircraft and these rudder pedals do not even come close to the real thing. The pedals have no feel to them and they do not have any method of adjusting the resistance. I had to adjust them so that their response was not linear just so they would operate in a reasonable fashion. I do not know if its the pedals or the flight model for the Cessna 172 in both Fs9 and Fs 10, but I am unable to perform a adequate forward or side slip. When applying rudder pressure on the right rudder pedal, the toe brake action also sets in (differential brake action). I can't get around this problem even after calibration and adjustment of the null zone. I haven't sent the pedals back to CH Products for replacement yet, so I can't say anything about the customer service.One thing is for sure: Amazon sells these pedals at a very competitive price. My prior peddles were the same model and I had them for some time and used them quite often. For what I used them for I cannot complain. I do think the price is a bit high.

{"context": "This is my second set in my life time. The last set of CH Pedals I owned was circa 1996. They lasted until the technology changed (they were serial cable & game port which disappeared by the early 2000's and replaced by USB). They proved to be extremely useful in todays flight games, especially War Thunder. The pedals eliminated the &#34;wobble&#34; that game normally introduces for joystick users and I've found now gives me the accuracy to compete against mouse/keyboard users. This unit functioned as advertised and took no knowledge to install. It is being used with Microsofts's Flight Simulator X and it was plug in the USB cable and start flying. The pilot's legs get a bit fatigued because there seems to be a different angle from a real cockpit. A different computer seat helps relieve the condition. The pedals don't have quite the same feedback as the real thing but that was expected, its a computer not a Cessna. No real complaints, it adds a lot of realism and allows forward and side slips as well as realistic spin recovery. I have owned this for well over a year now and it still works very well. I started using it on windows xp and now on 7 64bit with no problems at all. Works great like every other CH products item I've had !Only regret was to retire my CH game port version in order to start using this USB version.. old set still working fine after so many years.Windows XP forced the need to upgrade to USB however.Anything better built cost three times as much.Update: 8/08/2007 Still working just fine and no need to want better. I did pinch the cable once and they stopped working, which concerned me.The yoke is great, if again it would stay in place. I used a fold up utility table to set up my fly room. So to assist the marginal clamping system that comes on the unit, I used Velcro tape on the underside of the front of the yoke to hold it down. That worked great, but if you are setting up flight school on the dining room table you may end up in negotiations with the wife.

I love these pedals and the give a much more realistic feel, they also have the toe brakes so it is much like the real deal. I recomend them to anyone who wants a better Flight Sim experience. A well built item and easy to install with no software required. I would recomend it to anyone practicing instrument work. I don't know how anyone flies without these. I wondered why my simulator approaches were so pathetic, turns out that a little rudder is good for those tiny course corrections you need to put the plane down right where you want it.

I find that this means my legs are not totally relaxed like they are when I'm in a real Cessna, they're always a bit tensed up because you're having to keep them in the shoe cups.And finally, and this is my biggest pet peeve: The spring back to center is very weak. This is a real pain because you're left having to \"feel\" for a center ridge click to know your rudders are centered again.

{"context": "the usb pedals are a great addition to the flightsim yoke to make flying the sim more realistic. I use the simulator for instument procedures and proficiency and it is very close to the ELITE official simulators that prepare you for real-world flying but for a lower price. but they are very sensitive mechanically, so you have to adjust sensibility in your flightsim-software. materials are sturdy. very satisfied with CH Products. Cockpit accessories like approach plate holders, stopwatches etc. even fit on the yoke. next purchase will be the throttle quadrant from CH. Consider IL-2 again. It supports the first four controllers as sorted by Windows. If you have a yoke, pedals, flight stick, throttle, trim wheels, throttle quadrants, etc., then it requires plugging and unplugging of the controllers depending on the types of planes you want to fly. You also have to restart your game and reconfigure the axis settings each time you switch. I was able to eliminate all that by Ch Products' software. I just consolidated all my Ch Products gear into a smaller number of controllers, and then I able to fairly easily use the controls I wanted with the planes I wanted--and it took a fraction of a time to change.I have never used the Saitek pedals myself, so if you're wondering which you should buy, I can only say that you'll likely find them more comfortable because of the distance between the pedals, but you'll also find them less functional because the Saitek software (although quite good and easy to learn and use) just can't approach what the Ch Products Control Manager can do.If the Ch Products pedals were farther apart, I'd rate this 5 out of 5 stars. What I've read is that people with lips or other unperfect edges may have problems since the surface area of the clamps is small. Again, not a problem with my particular desk. Another con that I read about and can somewhat concur with is the trim quality. I find myself having to adjust the elevator trim more frequently with changes in speed than with my joystick...on approach this can be viewed as a nuisance or part of the greater challenge. I'll have to give it some time to decide on that one. FSX recognized the devices immediately and correctly assigned the rudder and break controls, but the throttle controls had to be reassigned inside FSX to make it closer to the controls in the real world Seminole. These USB Pedals don't simulate the leg aching force experience with real-word peddles during single engine operations, but then again, the real Seminole has rudder trim to eliminate the force needed for full rudder deflection during a single engine cruising flight. Also, I found that the thrust_scalar property in the [propeller] section of the SimObjects\\Airplanes\\Seminole\\aircraft.cfg file should be set to 1.0 to simulate the airspeeds and climb speed in the real-world Seminole that I'm training on. Great pedals. Smooth rollers and transition th rough the &#34;center' detent. Great control out of the box and outstanding customizing using the CH Control Manager.

{"context": "I have bought 3 joysticks by CH Products since 1994, THEY ALL STILL WORK. I have 2 of this USB Fighterstick model.

I did cut my own rubber pad to custom fit the handgrip base in order to raise my hand level where the use of the hat switch with my thumb is easier, it woud be nice if CH included some properly shaped pad layers with their units so that the handrest could be built up in layers to the correct height by each user (but this is really nitpicking).

I'm pleased with the stick overall, though there are a few minor issues.The good:The controls are very similar to the real controls found in the F-16 and A-10C, so binding the controls in DCS World and Falcon BMS is very straightforward. In practice, this is not an issue during gentle maneuvering, but it does take some getting used to. It is an issue during hard maneuvers, which is part of why this stick isn't very good for arcade flight games.The trigger is only one-stage, with a very short throw. This is bad for DCS A-10C, as the two-stage PAC trigger system is virtually essential to accurate gun runs in that particular sim. You can work around it by binding a key or button to PAC-1, but it doesn't feel as natural as a two-stage long-throw trigger.Conclusion:I would recommend the Fighterstick to study sim users who want an authentic controller but don't want to spend $400 on a Thrustmaster HOTAS Cougar or Warthog. So I can testify that their customer service, which at one time was top notch, has declined sharply as well.I was finally able to repair the stick myself, after following instructions from an outside forum, which involved having to disassemble the unit and rebuild it due to a large amount of backlash from a very improper fit of the pots. This is simply unacceptable in a stick of this price.I am sorry to have to write a review such as this, as CH used to be the best you could get, both in terms of quality as well as service. I recently purchased the CH Products Fighterstich USB to use in a flight simulation program and have been delighted with it. It is extremely smooth to operate and I find its programmable features both versitile, and easy to program to fit my needs. I have incorporated the Fighterstich with the CH Products Combat Pedals and the combination is assume! I received good service and prompt delivery using amazon.com.

If the manufacturers want this item to be bought by Mac owners, they had better make Mac set-up a lot easier. There is no owners Manual or software disk included. The new owner must download the drivers and CH Control Manager software from the CH website. Setup is a very simple operation which involves plugging your stick into it's own USB port and running the drivers software. Setup was completed without a hitch and I did not miss the absent owners Manuel. I then proceeded to use the CH Manager software to configure the stick for the first time. It was at this time that I encountered my first and only problem while using the software. i lack that with this handle. im am very much in need of a different handle, is there one? OK now the good news i found with it. everything else is great !!!! every thing else is a must have for flight gaming. i give 5 stars. handle, i have to give it a minus 5 stars..BTW i just plugged in and it took care of its self on my computer.no download no cd no nothing just plugged it in. I have had this joystick for a few years and tons of abuse and its always worked top quality.

{"context": "This controller has some really good...assignable options like ...multiple hat switches and buttons and a mode selector...But you can reach up to the controls only if ur body size was 6.5 feet minimum and u have hands to match...These are huuuuge.....its not possible to keep ur thumb in the angle for the lower hat switch and then just flick up to the pov hat switch...you will literally have to raise ur elbow and whole arm to reach it.and I am not a small person Im 6 foot.The most disappointing aspect was the trim control wheels.They are infact not controllers that you can just assign trim axises to...but a kind of caliberation mechanism for the stick itself...so when u use the elevator trim axis it modifies your joystick axis ever so slightly to have a upward or downward tendency....this really sucks in game as its very non intuitive and I found them very very difficult to control...kind of sad assuming I bought these transported all the way to India only because of the trim wheels :(.But having said that I must also say the joystick axis are very sensitive and nice....and having a seperate pivot for pitch and roll allows for very precise input..and they're built like beasts as well...very very tough...wish they would make one in a slightly smaller size as well...:( This was a great joystick when I first got it. The buttons are good, springs were good, the software is pretty good, physically it's very sturdy and it feels solid. The problems started after a few months of use. I started getting dead spots, drift and it sometimes didn't return to center in the games I played (physically it was centered, but the flight sim didn't think it was.) The bottom line is that by using pots (old style variable resistors) instead of Hall Effect sensors this joystick has a limited lifespan. When the pots wear out or get dirty it's done. I'd say 1 year of heavy use is a good estimate. You simply can't expect pots to last too long when you are constantly moving them for hours a day. They are really meant for occasional adjustment to volume and such in radios and TVs not for being hammered by continuous movement in a joystick. Hall Effect sensors don't suffer this problem because there is no physical contact between the moving parts. They use magnetic induction to determine the stick position. So, save yourself some money and get a Hall Effect joystick like the Thrustmaster T-16000M Flight Stick or go big and get an all metal one like Thrustmaster Hotas Warthog, Replica Split Throttle System. When I called tech support with a question, I spoke with someone in the states after just 2 rings, and the help I received was truly first rate.In terms of the stick's movement range, and centering, I found the springs were firm but light enough that I was able to smoothly traverse both axes and it quickly returns to center. The excellent CH Control Manger software registered smooth even travel across the entire range of movement. There is a trim wheel and a wheel you can use as a throttle if you don't pick up CH's excellent companion, the Pro Throttle, but this stick does not have a twist function, so be prepared to get pedals.

The huge center detent of the X52 is extremely difficult to work with, and since Saitek and Mad Catz got intertwined their QC has plummeted.Saitek X65f: Does not compare. Gimmick force sensing that Saitek cum Mad Catz will say is military type, but in reality the concept was rejected by the military for good reason. Reduced QC seems to be even more apparent here, with many reports of return-to-zero issues. I personally don't like the twist on most sticks, so this was not a con for me at all.In terms of looks, they are somewhat plain, but I'll take reliable and clean function over something that came out of a movie but falls apart after a few months.This compares very well the the Logitech 3D Extreme I owned previously, and I was able to purchase it at a reasonable price. If you don't need as many buttons, the CH Combatstick is an excellent alternative.I'm using this with Arma 2, Wings of Prey, IL2-Sturmovik, and DCS: World. Unlike Thrustmaster's best stick it doesn't have any outstanding quality control issues. The Fighterstick has an excellent maintenance record and I am confident that it will last me for many years of flight siming fun.Update: I stand corrected on the position of the stick in the real F-16, however I stand by my criticism of the feel of the stick when used in the desktop position.

{"context": "While this joystick may not have modern styling and plain colors, it performs better than any joyticks I've tried. Before this I had a CH Combatstick 568 and it lasted about 10 years. The POTS may not be the most precise instruments, but for the money, this works great. Had minor issues with the Z axis spiking when the X or Y axis is in motion. Most of this was correctable with deadband or damping. Would recommend more CH products... Looking at getting rudder pedals and maybe a throttle in the future. No longer is the hardware holding me back, it's all on me to be a better pilot. I still think they make the best bang for the buck. i got it yesterday, used it for about 4 hours. my hands where hurting. not a comfortable stick, to be nice. by very far its the worst stick, i ever used, as far as working the handle itself. its got a light spring, if it didnt i would have blisters all over my hand. my finger tips are sore now, a day later. my last stick was the EXTREME 3D pro. theres not a better handle than the 3Dpro to me. ive played a straight 10 hours before, with it.. my hand, arm and fingers felt as good at 10 hours as the first 5 minutes. In addition, the design has not changed in over a decade, and there are much more comfortable sticks, as well as much more accurate ones, for less money.

{"context": "BEWARE!! This joystick DOES NOT have \"twist\" capabilities, even though the description says \"3-axis.\" The three axes they're talking about are ailerons, elevator, and throttle -- NO RUDDER CONTROL!! I didn't realize this, and so I sent it back as soon as I received it and found out that there was no rudder control... How they can call this a Fighterstick is beyond me... No rudder control? Really? Sent it back... Buying something else, and making darn sure it has rudder control on it... It does not have a rudder twist. I rather like this, as it makes the x and y axis more precise. If the rudder is deal breaker for you, then I suggest you reconsider. I could easily asign the rudder to either of the two lower 4 way hat switches (both of which would be comfortably in reach of the tiniest of hands) and this stick would still provide a far smoother experience than any of the other sticks I have used.2. It is large, but not as large as some other reviewers have made out. The design may be a bit aged but this product is of high quality.Observations:At first the stick seems rather bulky and plastic, but the large base ensures it doesn't shift even with large control inputs, and the plastic construction is actually very sturdy. Relatively light control pressure is required and there is a distinct feel between actuating the stick on X or Y axis, but neither detract from the experience once you get use to it. The 4 hat switches all work great, and with the software downloadable from the CH products website there are an almost endless number of combinations for button setup. In addition, the design has not changed in over a decade, and there are much more comfortable sticks, as well as much more accurate ones, for less money.

But I cannot recommend this stick to anyone in the current state of things, unless they have the technical skill to modify and repair it to make it work like it should.I gave it three stars only because of it's potential once rebuilt and repaired. This thing is screwed together and uses heavy gauge plastic. The thing feels like you could drop it off a building, pick it up and start playing again. This sturdy construction does not take away from how comfortable it is. At first, I thought they could of done better with the ergonomics.

In particular, the weapon pickle button required stretching to reach.The throttle wheel is not very good as a throttle.

{"context": "I doubt I will be able to...I'll update this if I can successfully set them... it says 8 way 8 way D-pad... so we shall see. This isn't a huge issue for me since I like playing RPGs and Adventure games more than fighting games. We do not own a game console (xbox, wii or such) as we find that the kids already spend enough time on the computer. However, my son had recently gotten into role playing games like Titan Quest and Eragon. Using the keys to move was frustrating him. These work perfectly. In fact the 10 year old \"installed\" them himself and was playing both games with his 8 year old sister minutes later. They are quite well built for the price and seem to be comfortable for the kids and my husband as well. The two center buttons (9 and 10) should be toward the lower side of the gamepad, instead of the top, where they are harder to reach.3. While this gamepad works OK with games on my Mac without extra software, Logitech's website seems to offer software for Windows only... If you have a Mac and you want to assign key combinations to the controller, or configure it for use with Finder or other apps, you'll have to install a third-party program.Some points of advice for shoppers:1. Works fine with Lego StarWars 2 but no control at all of Lego StarWars 1. Good inexpensive controller for kids. The controller is solid. It has a nice grip, has 8 programmable buttons, and the d-pad has 360 degree rotation, which is a big plus when you're trying to move around when playing a game. Another big plus is this controller is literally plug and play--no cd installing is required. You just plug it in your USB port and play away. The only drawback I can see is possibly at least 2 more buttons (especially when it comes to emulation and the latest sports game). But overall I recommend this controller because it's affordable and easy to use.", "qas": [{"id": 42, "question": "does this work with windows 8.1", "answers": [{"answer_start": 478, "text": "These work perfectly."}, {"answer_start": 1205, "text": "Works fine with Lego StarWars 2 but no control at all of Lego StarWars 1."}, {"answer_start": 500, "text": "In fact the 10 year old \"installed\" them himself and was playing both games with his 8 year old sister minutes later."}, {"answer_start": 0, "text": "I doubt I will be able to...I'll update this if I can successfully set them... it says 8 way 8 way D-pad... so we shall see."}, {"answer_start": 1342, "text": "It has a nice grip, has 8 programmable buttons, and the d-pad has 360 degree rotation, which is a big plus when you're trying to move around when playing a game."}]}]}
{"context": "I first got these to play my Nintendo and SNES games in emulation software on my laptop that runs Windows Vista. The plug and play simplicity of these controllers was great and they worked wonderfully.When I tried to use them on my Windows 7 desktop, however, the computer wouldn't recognize the devices. But, fear not, it turns out that if you go to Microsoft.com there is a Logitech driver available for free download and the controllers work fine once again. This item is useless. It isn't compatible with most the games I have and doesn't work the way a controller should work. Often, some of the buttons can't be assigned an action and since most games require duel joysticks, you can't never look around with this controller. AHHHH!! ! This item wasn't as great as we thought it would be. It doesn't work with current role playing games. The description said it would, but it doesn't.

He is still making due with the keyboard til he gets a pad that works. We might be returning this and getting something else. This is a very simple plug and play joystick. I bought it due to the similarity of a PS2/PS3 controller. This controller does not disappoint. I used it for retro emulators and the mapping was easy. Plug it in and the driver will self install (Windows XP and 7). I found no delay in sensitivity or in the relay of information. I have not figured out how to work it with my Mac yet but I am sure it is possible. I have to admit that I went for this item because it was cheap and I generally regret paying top dollar for game controllers that break within months of being purchased.

Easy to install, great color options, and very durable. The description and picture matched perfectly to the item I received. Pros: These packs are the perfect way to charge your wii controllers without having to take out the batteries every time like with rechargeable AA batteries. The design of the grip is also a nice addition; comfortable, but not hampering like some of the skins that Nintendo makes.Cons: If you use these battery packs, you have to use the included back part that goes on the actual controller. This is annoying because I already have skins that I previously used for the controllers that now have become useless. That is another point, you cannot use any skins with these battery packs unless you want to take them off each time you want to charge them. This was so inexpensive and a definite necessity for the Wii. We went through so many AA batteries for the remotes and now we can just plug them into the charger and they are ready for the next time. One of the original batteries that came with the Nyko charger finally went dead and the other was getting close after many years of use. Didn't really need the new covers, but my daughter was happy that a pink one came with the order. Reasonable price considering how long the originals lasted and how much use we got out of them.

This Nyko Wii Battery Kit is great if you already have theWii Charge Stationbase. The base (sold separately) comes with two of these battery kits plus the base. Since the Wii can use FOUR Wiimotes, you'll need two additional batteries, and this Battery Kit fits the bill very well.The batteries hold their charge quite well and for a long time. They also don't take TOO long to charge up.Unfortunately, you can't set the batteries in the charger by themselves: They have to be attached to a Wiimote. I already have the dual charge base, but have four controllers. I didn't have room for another charge base, so buying the extra batteries, plus backs (because you can't use the jackets with these batteries). The backs have an opening to allow the charge base to charge the batteries. Also they have a rubbery coating that supplies a sure grip on the controller, but is way better than using the jackets that come with the controllers.I really like the convenience of this type of setup. My 20 year old son received this item plus another cheaper version. Apparently the battery grip is quite comfortable and he prefers this item over the other.

{"context": "Well I just did some research on this yoke and discovered that Sietek has resolved the phantom keystroke issue. New replacement units are shipping to all US distributers. If you happen to have a defective unit, per a post on Sietek's forum, owners are to call 310-972-9930 for return/replacement instructions. I am going to order one myself but am not sure if Amozon has the new units yet. Sietec refused to post a current serial number of the defective lot but a person on the forums said that he just got his and is working flawlessly with a serial number of SZ005111624. I bought this to replace my aging CH Yoke. I find it to be far superior in both feel and accuracy. Separating the throttle is a nice touch (I bought a second one for my twin props.) My experience In FSX so far has been excellent. There are no phantom key presses that I kept hearing about. The only thing I really miss from my CH Yoke is the mechanical trim which is the only reason I'm not giving this item 5 stars. As a private pilot, I fly sims to keep current with procedures. When it was time to replace my CH yoke/rudder, I'd hear about Saitek and decided to give them a try.The order came in quickly and I was pleasantly surprised at the construction. It seemed better built than the CH product line. The first issue I encountered was the height required to secure the yoke. I have a desk with a retractable keyboard drawer. The Saitek mounting hardware extends about 5\" below the desk, which forces me remove the keyboard drawer to use the yoke. I was initially hesitant about purchasing this product mainly because of all the Phantom Keypress issues I've been reading about. Besides, my CH Products Yoke seemed to be serving me just fine.Well, it appears Saitek has resolved the Phantom Keypress issue, and as such they have a winner on their hands. This product has definately upped the realism of my Flight Sim experience. It is solid, well built, and has plenty of key and buttons to assign when you set it up with FS9 (or FSX).What I really like about this product is the fact that the throttle/Prop/Mixture controls are separate from the yoke. Hello, I got this to replace my CH yoke and like it a lot. First thing I noticed is how well built it is. It was simple to set up. Gives me a more 'realistic' feeling than the CH yoke.

This is probably the best Flight simulator partner, but in my case it comes with a little desviation to the right side, so the yoke control yoke is not quite precise when is centered itself. I corrected this issue with the software driver in the calibration section, increasing the \"dead zone\", but I guess this should not happen, because let it less sensitive.

{"context": "I don't blame Saitek for this but I bring it up because I choose to upgrade to the Saitek Cessna Yoke. The Cessna yoke is more expensive but it is well worth it. I find it much smoother and the four way rocker on the left yoke handle is very useful, the pro flight one does not have that. Also, the feel of the Cessna throttles is superior to what I had on the pro flight model and the Cessna yoke turns a full 90 degrees. Much easier to control to ailerons.If you can afford it I recommend that you check out the Cessna version right here on Amazon. In their defense, I also own the Cessna version, while it is not all that smooth either, it is far better than this one was. I sent this one back and will just float my Cessna yoke from place to place. If you have the spare cash, I like the Cessna version, if you don't my old CH yoke was much smoother if you don't mind the toy like appearance. A Cessna 172 is sluggish and then over compensates when banking in real life, and if you have ever flown a 172, you know that you need to feel the aircraft to make much more accurate maneuvers, this yoke is very accurate except for the turning radius of the yoke (Cessna actually turn further than this yoke does). When using the yoke to fly or land a Beech twin, or a King Air 500, or even a Cessna 410, the yoke is exactly as responsive as when you are in the real plane. I researched the Pro flight against several others including CH Products flight yoke. This process consumed more than 2 months. So why did I purchase this yoke over the others? Well, when the yoke arrived from Amazon, very speedily, I was impressed by the solid construction of both the yoke and the throttle quadrant. The variety of buttons, POV location were right on and very easy to setup for Microsoft FSX. The included customization software was not the current version, but I was able to download the current version from Saitek's web site and to also register the product. I wish I had purchased the newer model. I guess this does what it's intended to do.

I got my private pilot license about 6 years ago and suffer from the fairly common complaint that I simply don't have enough time (or cash) to get up as often as I need to.When I was training for my license I purchased the CH Yoke and found that it was OK for practicing some of my maneuvers but it tended to \"stick\" quite a bit which made the experience somewhat awkward and translated to rather harsher performance in my real planes.Now, half a decade or so later, I am starting to get ready for my instrument rating and I purchased this Saitek offering (and the rudder pedals) along with Flight Simulator X to both keep my habits fresh and to eventually practice procedures when in IMC. As a private pilot who flies mostly Cessna 172's, I was looking for a game and flight control system that resembled the real deal to keep current on flying techniques. The throttle quadrant works very well. The yoke also works well. My complaints are that the clamps are plastic and I'm worried about breaking and that very slight movements appear unresponsive. It is close enough for me to get this practice in and is definitely a great product if you are not a real pilot just looking to play with some simulators. I've used the yolk for both Microsoft FSX as well as Instrument Pilot Trainer 7.0. I researched the Pro flight against several others including CH Products flight yoke. This process consumed more than 2 months. So why did I purchase this yoke over the others? Well, when the yoke arrived from Amazon, very speedily, I was impressed by the solid construction of both the yoke and the throttle quadrant. The variety of buttons, POV location were right on and very easy to setup for Microsoft FSX. The included customization software was not the current version, but I was able to download the current version from Saitek's web site and to also register the product.", "qas": [{"id": 62, "question": "what instrument which is not included?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 641, "text": "I installed them in the order: Yoke, switch panel, and finally the instrument panel."}, {"answer_start": 2204, "text": "I've used the yolk for both Microsoft FSX as well as Instrument Pilot Trainer 7.0."}, {"answer_start": 512, "text": "I purchased the Saitek Pro Flight Yoke, Power supply for the yoke, PRO Flight Switch Panel, and the Pro Flight Instrument Panel."}, {"answer_start": 0, "text": "As an instrument rated private pilot, I have used all versions of Microsoft FS to \"practice\" instrument flying, including the most current FSX."}, {"answer_start": 2699, "text": "The included customization software was not the current version, but I was able to download the current version from Saitek's web site and to also register the product."}]}]}
{"context": "I don't blame Saitek for this but I bring it up because I choose to upgrade to the Saitek Cessna Yoke. The Cessna yoke is more expensive but it is well worth it. I find it much smoother and the four way rocker on the left yoke handle is very useful, the pro flight one does not have that. Also, the feel of the Cessna throttles is superior to what I had on the pro flight model and the Cessna yoke turns a full 90 degrees. Much easier to control to ailerons.If you can afford it I recommend that you check out the Cessna version right here on Amazon. I read the reviews extensively before purchasing this Saitek flight yoke and decided to buy the cheaper of the two I was considering. The product felt sturdy out of the box and was ready to play once plugged into the computer. All the buttons functioned nicely.However, I have to say that it's MUCH easier to fly a real plane than trying to control the simulated counterpart using this flight yoke. I calibrated, recalibrated, messed with sensitivity and null zones until I was blue in the face. I couldn't get the ailerons to roll realistically, and the the pitch was waaay too touchy. When operating this yoke with my left hand, and working the throttle with my right, it's very difficult to make precise elevator control inputs because the yoke has a tendency to stick. Applying additional force will eventually move the yoke, but then it jumps, and you get too much control input. Very annoying. The yoke shaft is metal, and it is rubbing against a plastic sleeve. This inherently creates a lot of friction. It is impossible to move the yoke back and forth smoothly with one hand. Really poor design.Also the springs are too stiff. This reduced the tendency to over control. I have seen electric trim in some light planes positioned on the yoke. I have set the tree two way switches as my trim. Initially I had the \"repeat\" slider set to full and found it very difficult to precisely trim. I have backed it off to the middle setting and it is better but still easy to over trim. I believe that taking \"repeat\" off completely will be best.The quadrant movement was likewise smooth and precise. I found the zero detent very obvious, it takes very little effort to move past it, but you will know when you did. That made landing on narrow gravel strips very difficult. This one-sided dead zone is in the hardware; no software calibration can eliminate it. Setting the ailerons axis sensitivity to maximum and the null zone to zero in my Flight Simulator X did not help. The elevator control of the Saitek yoke sticks. I put a dab of soy oil lub on the shaft but it didn't make any difference. The detached quadrant with programmable buttons is a good design. All the quadrant control levers and the programmable buttons are easily accessible.", "qas": [{"id": 63, "question": "How bad is the tendency for this yoke to \"stick\" and \"bind\" when using both ailerons and elevator at the same time?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 1138, "text": "When operating this yoke with my left hand, and working the throttle with my right, it's very difficult to make precise elevator control inputs because the yoke has a tendency to stick."}, {"answer_start": 2522, "text": "The elevator control of the Saitek yoke sticks."}, {"answer_start": 1687, "text": "This reduced the tendency to over control."}, {"answer_start": 778, "text": "All the buttons functioned nicely.However, I have to say that it's MUCH easier to fly a real plane than trying to control the simulated counterpart using this flight yoke."}, {"answer_start": 1047, "text": "I couldn't get the ailerons to roll realistically, and the the pitch was waaay too touchy."}]}]}
{"context": "A lot of &#34;freeplay&#34; in the yoke. Yoke moves about 8-10 mm in both axis before movement shows up on screen. Not very precise. A waste of money. In order to enjoy this program you need to buy the Flight Yoke and throttle controls using the keyboard is difficult and not much fun. I also bought the rudder pedals, but it is going to take some time for me to get it all working together, I'm a beginner so the yoke and throttle is enough for now.If you are thinking of some day flying a plane this is the package to get. If you just want jump in and just start flying get something easier. Also USB extensions over 8 feet without an amp should not be used because I had problems with a 10 foot extension cable turning the yoke on and off.Good luck and happy flying. I just bought this product I did a lot of reading on it about the phantom Key's and switch's. Over the last 8 month's most reviews look good so I thought I would give it a try. The first unit got here and as soon as I plugged it in, you guessed it phantom switching. I sent it back and recieved another unit the same thing I'm sending this back and ordering the CH product yoke. I give saitek pro yoke 2 stars and those are for product design and apperance. When you buy this also buy the SAITEK PRO FLIGHT YOKE POWER ADAPTER (PZ44UX) as you need it to use the usb hub built into the yoke on the back side that has three usb plugins. You can always go to Saitek website and download drivers and updated software.

{"context": "My son loves this setup. He combined it with Microsoft Flight Simulator Gold Edition and now we can't get him out of his room! A pilot friend of mine said it would be a good investment for an aspiring pilot. We'll see! Excellent yoke and throttle quad for the price. I purchased this package to fly the Elite, X-Plane and FS 10 flight simulators. All work well. To consolidate the need to individually attach two devices to the desk, I combined the quad to yoke with velcro. Works very nicely. I like the ability to program the throttle quad to the aircraft I want to fly. Numerout switches on the yoke and quad allow for programming almost all functions that are needed in a flight sim. The software that comes with the unit provides total functionality in programming, because there are several &#34;modes&#34; that can be programmed with software, then selected on the yoke while flying. There are 2 mounting options for the throttle. **For FSX make sure you adjust the sensitivity for the throttles or you wont get the full range. The sensitivity should be all the way up and null zone all the way down** Unfortunately unlike a stick like the X-52 you don't have a rudder axis on the yoke so you will still need some way to use the rudder if you dont have pedals yet. The rudder axis can be mapped to a axis on the throttle quadrant but who wants to lose that axis to the rudder.I haven't had any issues with anything, it all worked right out of the box and was up and running in minutes.

I spent a lot of time trying to configure the yoke and throttle to work - each time, with everything calibrating fine, thinking I had solved the problems.

I emailed Amazon and they said it would be there by the 24th of Dec. That's fine, but I paid for one-day service, which didn't happen.

{"context": "I bought a Rock Band 3 Pro Guitar, Game and Cymbals and these drums for my kids for Christmas. These drums do NOT support the Pro Cymbals. It doesn't say this anywhere in the product description that these are not compatible with the PRO equipment. There was nothing wrong with the drums nor was there an issue with the seller. I'm writing this so others don't have a disappointment over this lack of compatibility. The Rockband Drum Set is a great value. They work perfectly with ALL Rockband and All Guitar Hero games that I know of. I own a variety of both games and the drums were definately worth the money. They are the funnest part of Rockband and Guitar Hero in my opinion. Everyone should buy the drums I've played alot of video games and used a lot of diffrent controllers, but playing the drums in rock band tops them all by far. Although the drums have more of a learning curve then the guitar they are still a blast when you get it down. If you have rock band you must have the drums, so if you don't have 'em you better get 'em. First off I cannot recommend picking up the official Rock Band drum pads enough for these. The lack of clack (see what I did there) makes a huge difference. The drums them selves are high quality and a lot of fun to play. If you're holding out for Guitar Hero 4 STOP! Pick up Rock Band now and see how rhythm games are done right! This game is very durable and Rock Band has a great warranty unlike Guitar Hero III who only has a 60 day warranty. My guitar quit working and Rock Band sent me a new one free of charge, all I had to do was secure it with a credit card to insure I would return my broken one, they mailed me a new guitar and a return shipping label. When I received my new guitar I used the box and shipping label and returned my defective guitar.

Wonderful little creatures that obey our every commands, making us feel like God, only without some smart-a$$ coming along and nailing things to cathedral doors.You're doubtless quite familiar with the Sims as a premise. Basically you create and control people. You run every aspect of their lives. You make them do their bidding, and if that means building a house full of nothing but wooden furniture and fireplaces, then by gum, you can do that! \"Sims 2\" is a massive improvement over the original game. Considering I jumped into the TS2 scene a bit late, this is what I started out with.Double Deluxe comes bundled with Celebration stuff and Nightlife, which means pretty balloons, wedding supplies, and cars for you (along with more community lots for your Sims to visit)!

If your computer cannot take DVDs, the game simply will not start. I had played the different Sims games on the PS2 gaming consoles, but it is so much more fun on the PC.

I also love the fact that you can purchase different vehicles. This game is very addictive. I played everyday for three weeks straight. Be prepared to get immersed in the stories. The only complaint I have is that there are only two body types available. You won't even feel the need to buy the other expansions.

Two boys who usually spend their time on COD4 and two girls who usually have no use for computer games.

{"context": "Easy macros (extremely useful for MMO gamers and for power users)Cons:1. No mechanical keys (but keys still have a nice feel to them)2. No anti-ghosting (mainly impacts FPS gamers)3. No rear height adjustment (a #2 pencil fixed this for me)I really wish that Razor/Microsoft/Logitech would make a keyboard that had all of the features of this keyboard, but fixed the ghosting problem and use mechanical keys. Until they do, I believe this keyboard is one of the best for anyone who is not a heavy FPS gamer. First let me say that I'm always a little hesitant to review Microsoft products and not give them a favourable rating as a knee-jerk due to the large amount of MS Shills and MS Stooges that patrol these pages voting negative on anything that's not 5 stars. These companies are always getting in trouble for this and Belkin is currently in the news for just this kind of thing ... and right here on Amazon.So ... without further gilding the lily ...I have to say that the product was ... far ... from what I expected.As soon as I took the keyboard out of its Rubik's Cube like packaging that it came in, I began to scratch my head and furrow my brow.I'm no stranger to the many different Gaming Keyboards / Keypads that are on the market. My old keyboard had broken from rough use and I needed a new one badly. I was directed to this particular model by a friend and I couldn't be more pleased. The red back light is adjustable and is surprisingly bright. Easy to install and set up and the mappable macro keys are just awesome and easy to use. One thing that is kind of annoying is the volume knob, you have to turn it slowly up or down to reach your desired volume otherwise it will go either to the maximum or minimum depending on the direction you were turning it. Hello,This keyboard might be the best looking keyboard in the market but is it the best gaming keyboard ? absolutely NOT !!! Not even close !!!! This keyboard suffers from a ghosting problem. Not only with ctrl+w+r but with other combinations too. I have much cheaper keyboards that doesn't have a single ghosting problem and this one got plenty... I was wondering why Microsoft did not withdraw all the keyboards and instead on solving the problem with a new keyboard \"X4 and cheaper too???!??!\" and i'm not feeling comfortable remapping keys to ESDF to be able to reload while moving forward+crouching.If ghosting is not a problem for you, go for it.If ghosting will be an issue, forget about this keyboard. don't waste your money.I just gave it 2 stars because of its looks and the switchable keypad, otherwise I would have gave it 1.", "qas": [{"id": 81, "question": "Ghosting Does anybody know if this keyboard has anti-ghosting?

{"context": "Specifically, if you have a game (like FFXIV:ARR) that requires you to often hit the start or select buttons, I find that I often end up hitting the more raised buttons just above them. Even just grazing those buttons will cause the XMB to pop up, which is highly disrupting during gameplay.Another downside to the keypad is sadly a consequence of one of its better features: The keypad falls asleep and powers off after some time and comes back on when you press a button, but you have to wait for it to start up whenever that happens. I really wanted to like this product because it was made specifically by Sony to use on their PlayStation controllers so I bought it thinking it would be the best option. After a couple of uses, this product feels very awkward when using it with the PlayStation controller. The key board covers the front portion of the controller and even gives you a PS button to use but your hands would have to be huge to reach over the top portion of your regular controller in order to type anything at all. I ended up typing very slowly and awkwardly with my two index fingers the times that I did use it. Surprisingly, the feature works smoothly over the buttons. Its easy to connect, and the battery seems to last forever. If you're planning on any wireless playstation keypad, its not doubt that this is the one you should get you're hands on. Everything about this device is flawless. Its almost a guarantee you will be satisfied. Especially if you're doing a lot of PSN messaging n' stuff. The wireless keypad for the PS3 system allows you to send text messages to others on PSN by using a keypad..Works well but the downside is the buttons are WAY TOO SMALL in my opinion.. I got this keyboard thinking it could be used for the youtube app, but it works only for internet search and PSN messages.", "qas": [{"id": 82, "question": "Will this work in games from PSN?

{"context": "I purchased this for use with FFXI, however the PS3 cannot use bluetooth accessories with PS2 emulated games, making this device worthless for me! Didn't know this until it was too late. I would really love it if it would work; the design is great and seems to be made well, but with this shortcoming, I have no use for it. The device is very small in size and not of much benefit. Apps like youtube won't even support this device and i mostly use it for sending messages to friends on psn. The keyboard it's so helpful with typing and browsing since the entire keys with a press of a button become a Mouse pad, for browsing on PS3; same concept as using the mouse pad on a notebook with a lil difference that the surface its not smooth but get used to it in matter of sec/min.I do have to make a point I desided to write a review here for. One of the reasons it's because I strongly believe people who sell a item and try to be so sneaky with shipping and handling are scammers and I won't support people who are dis/honest. Basically you hit the 'finger' button, and swipe your finger across the keyboard buttons, and it will control things like your home page and mouse cursor if applicable. It's a cool feature, but sometimes it sends your mouse or whatever you're doing haywire, very unreliable. Also, I couldn't really play fighting games like Marvel vs Capcom with this. It somewhat obstructs the R1 and L1 buttons, but that could just be me and my fat fingers.Pros:- Great deal for $20- Speeds up typing for things like MMROPGS or those really long messages- Easy to attach to your PS3 controller- Very familiar QWERTY format- Battery life is great- Auto-off featureCons:- Touch scrolling feature very finicky and unreliable, but cool when it works.- Slightly obstructs things like R1 and L1 (I couldn't play fighting games with this on...)- Takes quite abit of time to get used to, especially when typing symbols.Overall, it's a great addition to any PS3 user who types a lot, and I highly recommend it for any PS3 user if you have a spare $20 laying around. Going against my best judgment, I started playing some interactive games on PS3 only to understand that a keyboard was a necessity for group game playing. After some research and hearing from other gamers about using the PS3 wireless keypad, to keep up with communication within a game, I finally purchased this keypad from Amazon.I had no prior idea of the physical size of the device until I was surprised to see it arrive in a very small box.

{"context": "I bought this with the sole intention of using it for Final Fantasy XIV Online, however it only lets you type one key at a time and pause nearly 5 seconds between keystrokes making it nearly impossible to use. It does work well with other applications such as the Playstation store or messenger. Fits the controller well and isn't very heavy at all. Most would be better off with a regular USB keyboard for the same price. Before Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn came out, I wanted to make sure I had something I could use to easily type into my PS3 at a moment's notice. I already have the Logitech PS3 bluetooth keyboard, which is an excellent traditional computer keyboard. However, I was interested in the Wireless Keypad because it latches onto the controller and therefore is more convenient while playing.Unfortunately, I've found it to be relatively hard to use. First of all, the keys are tiny and I have large thumbs and fingers. this little attachable Bluetooth qwerty board is invaluable to me.I bought it for ps3 version of final fantasy 14 ARB it has brought console gaming on par with pc gaming in text only communicative settings. its a bit difficult to get the hang of at first but once mastered ads a whole new level to the game. I would highly recommend it as a must to all ps3 players. I suppose if I played a lot of Final Fantasy I might be more excited by this product. I seriously waited over two years before I got this thing. And when I finally got it, I had little use for it.If I didn't have a headset or a full-size USB keyboard, this would be slightly preferable to using the hunt-and-peck onscreen keyboard. I have yet to find a solution to the problem and most likely will not buy another one. If you are looking for a small, light, and controller mountable keyboard that lasts around 2 years then this will fit your criteria, if not, I would consider investing a bit more money into wireless keyboard that has more versatility with back light functionality for those who play at night and want to cut off time back spacing to correct errors deriving from big fingers, poor lighting, and disconnection.", "qas": [{"id": 85, "question": "Does the PS3 wireless keypad work on the PS4?

This thing is blu tooth and most importantly is rechargeable via USB same as your PS3 controller. Also you will have no trouble syncing it to your PS3...It does it automatically when you turn the device on and start typing. I gave it a 3 star rating only because the keys do not light up. If it did, it would be GREAT!!! !NOTE: Trouble Shooting Tip: When the battery is low or the device is out of sync, it will flash red and green lights on the device. The letters, numeric and punctuation keys are where you would expect them to be but the special keys are not exactly at their familiar places and some of the less essential ones (PgUp, PgDn, End, Home and the function keys) are missing. Special characters can be entered with the help of 2 modifier keys (the Blue and the Orange).Three special keys allow you to enable the touch pad mode or quickly jump to your PS3 message box or friends list icons - I did not find the last 2 very useful.Until you make yourself familiar with some of the less obvious key combinations it's a good idea to save the instructions pamphlet (a 17\"x11\" folded sheet) found in the package.The touch pad mode is very interesting in that, after pressing the 'touch pad key', the keyboard is disabled and a section of the keyboard emulates a laptop's touch pad and the 2 cursor keys emulate mouse buttons and you can interact with your environment as if you were using a mouse.I am a 'knob' person as far as mouse emulation is concerned but, based on my testing, the touch pad mode, while interesting and innovative, is not very well implemented.

{"context": "Great affordable headset for gaming, chatting or just listening. Sounds great and very affordable. I have bought a set for all 3 of my kids and they have help up well. SO if you have a kid who wants a XBOX 360 headset or PC headset for gaming or otherwise then this is a good choice. This is one way to stretch $20.00. Keep in mind that if you want it to work on your XBOX 360 you much buy the version of this that comes with a Xbox 360 headset adapter. I bought along with a Headset Buddy Adapter. It just sound awful. Seconds after after opening this to play on Xbox Live, the sound was just awful and I had to keep moving the cord at angle just so that I could be able to hear the other players talk. AWFUL DO NOT BUY! I purchased this headset for my online class live sessions and it has proven to be well worth the price. The material is very lightweight and doesn't press down on my ears tightly like my old headset. I am also a gamer and love the great stereo sound effects that are provided with the headset, which includes a volume control that can be clipped on my shirt while the headset is in use. No installation download was needed. Just plugged it into my laptop, and it was ready to go. Would recommend this to anyone who desires an inexpensive headset with microphone attachment at a great price!! I live in a two story home so whenever someone yells for me from downstairs I usually could hear them through my old headset, but with the new one I can hardly hear their voices anymore. )Well that's all for now. I hope this review helps a little for those who are considering this product. I'd say it's worth it. Initially the plastic ear covering got kinda hot and suck to my ears a bit, and I had to take them off (Mind you I live in Arizona where the climate is kinda warmer than usual). After awhile I either got used to it, or it was just happens because they were new. Still it isn't super comfortable, but but still fine after I broke them in.As I mentioned before I had this headphone for 5 months. Just a week ago the left earpiece of the head phone was significant quieter than the right.", "qas": [{"id": 92, "question": "are these headsets adjustable and suitable for an 8yr old for 360 xbox live", "answers": [{"answer_start": 319, "text": "Keep in mind that if you want it to work on your XBOX 360 you much buy the version of this that comes with a Xbox 360 headset adapter."}, {"answer_start": 520, "text": "Seconds after after opening this to play on Xbox Live, the sound was just awful and I had to keep moving the cord at angle just so that I could be able to hear the other players talk."}, {"answer_start": 1315, "text": "I live in a two story home so whenever someone yells for me from downstairs I usually could hear them through my old headset, but with the new one I can hardly hear their voices anymore."}, {"answer_start": 827, "text": "The material is very lightweight and doesn't press down on my ears tightly like my old headset."}, {"answer_start": 168, "text": "SO if you have a kid who wants a XBOX 360 headset or PC headset for gaming or otherwise then this is a good choice."}]}]}
{"context": "This game is for all ages. Young and old. You can play this game for hours, and easily lose track of time. What I like best about this is that you can play on the classic tracks from snes and the n64. PLUS, you can play with others online.You don't have to buy the wii wheel to experience the awesomeness of mario kart wii. You can use your wii remote or the remote + nunchuck. I personally like to use the remote + nunchuck combination. Easy to maneuver and the buttons right there without trying to find where they are! It give you full and total control so you can make necessary, last minutes maneuvers and successfully achieve them. You can play this using the Wii remote only, the Wii remote and nunchuck combo, the Wii steering wheel, the classic controller, and the nintendo gamecube controller. With so much ways to play, any and everyone can find a control scheme they love. Thought I'd be playing this with my gamecube controller but the wii remote/nunchuck combo is the ideal control scheme to master this, and feels the best when doing tricks etc. The gameplay is definitely challenging, and definitely worth its while with great courses like the kooky Coconut Mall, the Bomb-omb kart filled, traffic blocked Moonlit Highway, and classic courses like Bowser Castle from Mario Kart 64, and Peach's Garden from Mario Kart DS. The gameplay is definitely fun, where you can play against others online through the net, internationally by the Wii Wi-Fi connection, which works seamlessly. The control for the game handles well from each of the courses, with the Wii-mote & Nunchuck controls, the Nintendo Gamecube controller (for original Nintendo Wii gamers only,) the Wii Classic Controller, and the Wii-mote with the steering wheel attachment, that originally came with Mario Kart Wii, but you can buy seperately.All in all, if you have just bought a Nintendo Wii U, and you would like some of the classic games for the Nintendo Wii library, this is definitely one definitive game to start. This game is great. It is full of action, and the cool thing is that you can use the Wii remote as a steering wheel or use the remote+nunchucks to have a less interactive gameplay style. CRAZY FUN!!!!!! A great game. 5 stars from me!! ! Mario Kart. A video game classic.

{"context": "With Nintendo winding down on the Wii and putting its emphasis on the Wii U, many gamers are eager to see what Nintendo is going to develop. But for games for the Nintendo Wii, they still are playable on the new system. But there are games that are still defiant and driven in the way that the original Wii was designed for. That is definitely the case with Mario Kart Wii. It really is one of those games that continued to expand on a racing franchise that has gotten better with time. The game series had definitely taken a new direction when it came out for the Nintendo DS before, and it delivered with online gameplay, and battling against others through the internet. I didn't expect anything in the way of voice chat (after all, it is Nintendo we're talking about), but a something akin to a system of predetermined emotes would have went a long way in making the online mode feel like you're playing with human beings.I think that it would have been so much better if Mario Kart Wii had focused more on racing and less on the powerups. This is almost inexcusable: When I'm winning, the Blue Turtle shell of death will come. And when I'm losing, I can rest assured that sixteen million Mushrooms will come my way and get me back in the race. Graphics for this game are beyond amazing. The racing is super fast, so keep your eyes wide open! :) Some levels you will see have been used in past systems and future systems, like the 3DS. Selection is great and levels are fun. You never wanna stop playing! :) Hours of fun, I do recommend getting the steering wheels. I bought this for my 7yr old and me and my wife have enjoyed it also. It has tracks from all the old Nintendo systems, SNES, N64, Gamecube to name a few. Also new tracks, I must warn you the new Rainbow Road on 150cc is insane! There are a lot of unlockable carts and bikes and characters. Balloon and coin battle are lots of fun. This game is a must buy if you have enjoyed any previous Maro Kart or are a fan of fun racing games. Online leader boards and ranking systems have you playing this game a lot trying to rank with the best, especially during tournaments, which are still dolled out on a regular basis. Nintendo hasn't started neglecting service to this game one bit, and it's because it never got old or boring to the players. After installing the Mario Kart Channel that comes with the game, you'll be emailed a message by Nintendo letting you know whenever there's tournaments etc.The controls are aggressively tight, and impressively responsive. I've never had a complaint controlling this game.", "qas": [{"id": 94, "question": "i have a wii system does this game work with both wii and nintendo systems", "answers": [{"answer_start": 141, "text": "But for games for the Nintendo Wii, they still are playable on the new system."}, {"answer_start": 674, "text": "I didn't expect anything in the way of voice chat (after all, it is Nintendo we're talking about), but a something akin to a system of predetermined emotes would have went a long way in making the online mode feel like you're playing with human beings.I think that it would have been so much better if Mario Kart Wii had focused more on racing and less on the powerups."}, {"answer_start": 1640, "text": "It has tracks from all the old Nintendo systems, SNES, N64, Gamecube to name a few."}, {"answer_start": 0, "text": "With Nintendo winding down on the Wii and putting its emphasis on the Wii U, many gamers are eager to see what Nintendo is going to develop."}, {"answer_start": 2002, "text": "Online leader boards and ranking systems have you playing this game a lot trying to rank with the best, especially during tournaments, which are still dolled out on a regular basis."}]}]}

Mario kart Wii is like your typical Mario kart game. There's not much to be said but the game offers a wide range of characters from Mario (of course) himself to baby characters like Mario,peach and daisy that made their debut on the Nintendo GameCube.

The controls have you driving everywhere, but where you want to go due to lag. Gameplay gets old after 10 minuets and your friend will get bored. Also, the addition of bikes is stupid! It's not super bike or dirt bike cart its Mario Kart. They tired to add a new addition of power up, the Ink squirt, which paints your whole screen in black Ooze, making near impossible to see.

{"context": "Totally worth it guys.- Updates from Sony are the worst thing ever. Almost completely useless. Once again, you won't regret cracking it.- Last, and by far the worst con. The Headphone jack in my Psp is broken within the PSP, so now all I get is the \"backtones,\" as I like to call them, of any sound coming through headphones I've plugged in, making the music and video function useless.My Experience:My experience with the PSP 3000 was fantastic. I started out with a simple 3000, a 4gb memory card, and Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep, and eventually transitioned to....Well, I lost my memory card, but luckily I had backed up most of my saves to MediaGo. The charger jack? Just a charger jack. The headphones jack? Just a headphones jack. But right next to it, there is a small plug in thing, not sure what exactly that is. :/I like how you can remove and upgrade the battery pack at anytime. The UMD cover is just dandy, works like a charm. I really like how the UMDs are covered all of the time so there is only about 1sq.cm of exposed surface.The memory stick holder is awesome! (again with the easily impressed-ness) It's just a little piece of plastic with strips of rubber, but It just feels so cool! I bought this to play Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines, and also to use it for other stuff. The build of the device is sturdy, though it looks heavy and it is not, which gives off a \"cheap\" feel to it.The headphones jack and power jack are placed horrible, if I want to hold this with headphones in while it is charging, it is hard to grasp it or, to leave it laying on say, a pillow.Also, I'm not sure but, I bought this expecting it to be new, but it seems to be refurbished(the battery was beat up pretty bad, didn't look the best). This kit was not why that headphone and charger for the network, until this time, so that I did not send anybody and my child is very upset about this! Well I decided to go with the PSP 3000 instead of the GO. The main deciding factor was that the GO has a smaller screen size which is just not cool with me. Also the 3000 WILL take 16gig memory cards so the GO has no advantage there and may be at a disadvantage without a UMD slot.The 3000 is slim, well built, and has a nice feel in the hand. The screen is large and brilliant though glare and fingerprints remain to be a problem. The speakers sound great for how small they are and the system has lots of power with reasonable battery life.I do not think it deserves five stars though because the web browser is clumsy and slow.", "qas": [{"id": 105, "question": "Does this item have a Headphone Jack?....and if so, what size is the Jack?

{"context": "the music player is a great feature so when my ipod dies this thing's got my back. the graphics with the compatilbe camera is also something to brag about... its like a really awesome, high pixel resolution camera... oh and this baby is really strong contrary to popular belief... i must have drop this thing a million times (twice down the stairs).now the things that could improve is the wifi.... the wifi is really weak, i gotta be about 10 metres from the access point to get high speed internet. This is useless for me but hey!3- Screen artifacts (interlacing -look a like) are NOT an issue. I had to putt the screen 1 inch away from my eyes and move the camera to be able to see the artifact in the corners of some stairs in a 3D game. Its stupid to complain about this so if you are concerned, DON'T be.4- UMD AND PSN options: unlike the PSPGo, UMD are still compatible, and you can also download PSP-PS1 games from the store.I have enjoyed this version a LOT MORE than my old PSP2000 (mostly due to the improved screen). The concept of the \"core pack\" used to mean that it contained everything the player needed to get started. Though it does have an AC adapter, the USB cable to connect it to your PS3 or computer, the Memory Stick Pro Duo that you'll need to save and install data, a case to protect the pretty piano black from looking less so, and a remote control are all missing. Too, the unit frequently complains of being \"out of memory\" when online even with a 2 GB Memory Stick, something the mylo never did.Some of the units advanced features like Ad Hoc mode, the PlayStation store, SensMe Channels, and the camera peripheral I haven't been able to use, but I'd suggest this as not only a great gaming device, but a useful media player as well. Note the psp can be exactly like the nintendo dsi so what theres no touch sceen just buy the go camera not only can you take pictures but you can record video with audio all of that can be saved on the psp of course and as far as plain audio recording goes you can get a sony or phillips audio recorder that is compatable with the psp just keep looking I did and I found it all of that is a defenite buy besides the psp also can get mods for game boy advanced, sega, nes,snes, n 64 etc. many homebrew apps allow you run emulators, Java games, and their very own games; not to mention ISO/CSO's.The battery life is good, even though once it hits 2 bars, you immediately want to recharge it. For powers sake turn off wlan switch and set the volume to about halfway the meter. There is a built in microphone for Skype and multiplayer, but if you want to play multiplayer, you arch-nemesis has to be in the same room as you, so....I don't have the PSP camera or a protective case...um..., oh yeah: the AV cables are good for playing video... not so much for games 16:9, only 4:3 games look good on a tv through an AV cable.", "qas": [{"id": 106, "question": "this have camera?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 597, "text": "I had to putt the screen 1 inch away from my eyes and move the camera to be able to see the artifact in the corners of some stairs in a 3D game."}, {"answer_start": 2538, "text": "There is a built in microphone for Skype and multiplayer, but if you want to play multiplayer, you arch-nemesis has to be in the same room as you, so....I don't have the PSP camera or a protective case...um..., oh yeah: the AV cables are good for playing video... not so much for games 16:9, only 4:3 games look good on a tv through an AV cable."}, {"answer_start": 1393, "text": "Too, the unit frequently complains of being \"out of memory\" when online even with a 2 GB Memory Stick, something the mylo never did.Some of the units advanced features like Ad Hoc mode, the PlayStation store, SensMe Channels, and the camera peripheral I haven't been able to use, but I'd suggest this as not only a great gaming device, but a useful media player as well."}, {"answer_start": 83, "text": "the graphics with the compatilbe camera is also something to brag about... its like a really awesome, high pixel resolution camera... oh and this baby is really strong contrary to popular belief... i must have drop this thing a million times (twice down the stairs).now the things that could improve is the wifi.... the wifi is really weak, i gotta be about 10 metres from the access point to get high speed internet."}, {"answer_start": 1764, "text": "Note the psp can be exactly like the nintendo dsi so what theres no touch sceen just buy the go camera not only can you take pictures but you can record video with audio all of that can be saved on the psp of course and as far as plain audio recording goes you can get a sony or phillips audio recorder that is compatable with the psp just keep looking I did and I found it all of that is a defenite buy besides the psp also can get mods for game boy advanced, sega, nes,snes, n 64 etc."}]}]}
{"context": "Can't play new game without firmware update. Can't update the firmware without a memory stick.I wish the product page said you had to buy a memory stick -- the page says \"for storage expansion\", which makes it sound optional. Sony is in the memory stick business. The console ought to come with at least a small memory stick (64MB) to get started and install latest updates. I'm disappointed in Sony, and my son is very disappointed that he can't use his new PSP until he saves another $20 for a memory stick so he can download the firmware update so he can play the Lego Clone Wars game he already purchased. The only dissapointment was this did not come with a screen protector nor did it come with headphones. I had purchase a renewed one locally and received both of those items with it so I was surprised that the new one did not come with it. I also was unaware that a memory card was not included. I felt this information should be advertised with the unit so an &#34;uninstructed&#34; person would know the card was necessary to download games.

I expected a brand new psp 3000, but obvious the box has been opened before! The psp it self also looked has been touched or used before. the charger and chord doesn't not have any plastic cover, I see the unboxing video on youtube, it should have plastic cover if it's new!!!!

{"context": "That alone would have brought a lot more button combinations to the games.The ON/OFF switch is ok, nothing special here, just a slidie thing in a convenient spot where I wouldn't accidentally switch it off. The WLAN(wifi) switch is basically the same kind of switch on the top. Next to the WLAN switch, right in the middle, there is the same plug in that you see on the PS3 controller(a miniB I think it's called? IDK), so you can use the cord that comes with your PS3 to plug in to any USB port. I must admit for a long time I was not a fan of portable systems. I much prefer playing games on my PC or a big screen TV with the 360 or ps3. Since the mid 80's I have loved playing video games, and over time the Japanese Role Playing game, and Strategy role playing games became my favorite. The problem this generation was that for the most part they were few and far between on the 360/ps3. Sure you had exceptions like Disgaea, Valkyria Chronicles and Lost Odyssey. However, it was nothing like the SNES through the ps2 era. PlayStation 3000. This is a nice machine, piano black and glossy. I just love that look. I also own a 1000. The new one has much faster load times and I have noticed much brighter colors and the screen is defiantly glare proof. Words cannot describe what you can get out of any of these products along with a PS3, but I will try. If you have a home network these systems can connect directly to your wireless router and your ps3. This might be techie or geeky but you can even play certain ps3 games on your Psp via remote play option, you can download and play ps1 games on the psp anywhere you want to. Not so with the PSP 3K -- it picks up lots of wireless signals all over town and you usually have several to pick from...conects in under 30-seconds - and this makes Skype a real alternative to an expensive cell phone if you live in a metropolitan area. I Skype out most anytime I want to now, no matter where I am, using the PSP 3000.The included internet browser is very nice and supports flash and a lot of other plug-ins you need to view sites fully. The other con i have is the charging cord is on the bottom & its easy to pull on it making the plug-in a little loose. I suggest not playing it while charging it & unhook it when the charge is complete. There might be a charging dock for the batteries themselves & you could just have 2 batteries, 1 in the psp while the other charging. Another is having 2 psps but highly unlikely if you don't have the money. But after seeing the PSP Go, you might want to buy a backup PSP 3000.What seperates this from the Nintendo DS?", "qas": [{"id": 108, "question": "does this plug into ps3 console?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 791, "text": "The problem this generation was that for the most part they were few and far between on the 360/ps3."}, {"answer_start": 1357, "text": "If you have a home network these systems can connect directly to your wireless router and your ps3."}, {"answer_start": 414, "text": "IDK), so you can use the cord that comes with your PS3 to plug in to any USB port."}, {"answer_start": 2087, "text": "The other con i have is the charging cord is on the bottom & its easy to pull on it making the plug-in a little loose."}, {"answer_start": 563, "text": "I much prefer playing games on my PC or a big screen TV with the 360 or ps3."}]}]}

PSP 3000 is my favorite handheld gaming device. First off, the battery lasts long time & i can quickly switch it or NOT use a battery. The charger cord goes out the side so I can play laying down in bed while tilting it upright. On the 3G VITA version 2.05, battery not last that long & can't replace it.

{"context": "The first of the trilogy, Sands Of Time, is one of my favorite games of all time. After selling my PS2, and my only copy of the game, I had to find another console/system to purchase the game for. Considering the amazing price of this trilogy and the high quality of these games, this was pretty much a no-brainer. While I feel that the 2nd and 3rd games aren't quite as good as the original, they are still very solid games that are worth playing.Since I'm not a big PC gamer, I was somewhat concerned my graphics card might not be able to run the game at high settings, but sure enough, the advancement in graphics technology made running this game a breeze, even though my card is not top-tier. I first fell in love with PoP in the Sands of Time PC game. Years later (now), I discovered that they made two other games. I searched around and found this game at a fantastic price. Also, unlike PoP games Warrior Within and Two Thrones, it doesn't have StarForce.My main complaint: Warrior Within. Some people say different things about it, but I couldn't get through it. I tried, I really did, but it was too painful, so I stopped about 25% in. I first played prince of persia The two thrones on PS2 if I remember right and was addicted so I bought the pc version. Warrior Within and Sands of Time never played but willing to give it a go. I have windows 7 and they all seem to play ok. I highly recommend buying this game. If you are buying brand new, make sure you contact seller and see if it is factory sealed meaning wrapped in plastic. Just beware of the red one when you go shopping ;)Prince Of Persia Sands of Time Trilogy I purchased this package of 3 old school Prince of Persia games not knowing whether they would run on my laptop. But all three work and are great! There was a graphics card warning (mine is not supported by the game apparently) but I have experienced no issues. I have a Dell Inspiron 1545 Laptop with some personal modification such as memory and hard drive upgrades I did myself. I run Windows 7 as well which is not supported by the game but again, no issues and the games run great. I even installed these on my sons' desktop which is Windows XP Pro (the desktop was built by me) and have had no issues there either.I'm very pleased with my purchase---three games for 7 bucks...seriously even gamespot can't pull that off!

I even installed these on my sons' desktop which is Windows XP Pro (the desktop was built by me) and have had no issues there either.I'm very pleased with my purchase---three games for 7 bucks...seriously even gamespot can't pull that off! If that does not help ( It helped me with different games but not PoP T2T ) I searched for quite awhile before finally finding a fix that worked. here is the instruction on how to solve this problem:Go to My computer> Local Disk C:> programs file > UBISOFT> PrinceofPersiaT2T> Hardware.ini> Change NonPow2Textures=0 to NonPow2Textures=1 > File Save then Exit out and then right click Hardware.ini > select properties > check read-only box > select ok ~ Enjoy the smooth video playback :)( It's amazing what 1 number can do lol )Even today the gameplay in this series holds up and if you never played them or just want to re-live the experience you had years ago the Sands Of Time Trilogy is an excellent collection. Okay, so I have not purchased this yet because I have some question .Would somebody be willing to answer?1.Do I need internet to play campaign mode on these games.If I do, I cant buy this because my Windows XP PC no longer has internet(it had dial-up).2.Would It be possible to play these games with an xBox 360 controller? I have played Backyard Football 07 with the PC controls as Prince of Persia is different I would not feel comfortable.If a different game controller is required (e.g. Great games, If you like this type of games buy them, a little old but i'm running them on windows 7 with a logitech controller and no problem at all.

{"context": "I first fell in love with PoP in the Sands of Time PC game. Years later (now), I discovered that they made two other games. I searched around and found this game at a fantastic price.

I tried, I really did, but it was too painful, so I stopped about 25% in. I purchased this package of 3 old school Prince of Persia games not knowing whether they would run on my laptop.

{"context": "Scroll wheel gears wore out and now the mouse scrolls up when you try to scroll down. Makes using the scroll wheel impossible, even for middle clicking. I can't even scroll through a web page. The teeth on the gears are so worn out that it scrolls when I middle click.The rubber grips also fell off the sides of the mouse due to bad glue.Boycott Razer. I've paid too much for their trash. Their mice might have the highest DPI on the market but they only last a couple years at most. I switched to this Mamba from a Logitech Revolution MX - which I loved. Ultimately though, that mouse was a complete piece of crap compared to this Mamba. The Mamba is a FANTASTIC mouse with insane precision and control.The ONLY thing I miss from my upgrade was the killer scroll wheel (and clutch) from the Revolution MX. But Logitech software was HORRIBLE. (They've also killed the scroll wheel - proving they got it right on the MX by accident).The Mamba though is an instant win. Totally easy to use, feels great, and very easy to control.I sometimes put in 14-16 hour days... and if I don't charge this piglet during lunch or whatever, the battery WILL die on me around 14 hours. The Razer Mamba mouse was just spoiling myself. I could have simply used a standard laser mouse but I wanted a wireless gaming mouse. The Mamba ergonomically feels great on the hand. The top layer of the mouse has a rubberized feel for superior grip. The scroll wheel is very comfortable with every click. The sensitivity is very responsive and found no problems whether I was wired or wireless. The Mamba looks visually awesome with its blue light illuminating the scroll wheel. Although not necessary, it is a very good mouse. Pretty pricey, but I found it refurbished and find no flaws in it so far. It also does not come ready to use out of the box, you will need to update the firmware and synchronize the mouse with the dock after updating the firmware. Users might also have to tone down the mouse motion speed in the control panel so the pointer wont move around too quickly. It might not work with your mouse pad as its really sensitive and tends to jump around when used on some surfaces. I also highly suggest you use a gaming grade mouse pad with this as it will greatly improve your accuracy and reduce quirkiness of the mamba in games.Pros:- Looks really Sexy- Simple firmware update process- 7 buttons (2 left side, 2 small top left *controls sensitivity*, Left MB, Right MB, and Center Mouse Wheel)- Comes with a charging dock that acts as a wireless receiver- 5600 DPI with 1000 hz polling speedCons:- Doesnt work well on some surfaces it will jump around and act quirky- Not accurate when used with a Snipers rifle in FPS games without a gaming grade mouse pad.- The two small top left buttons are for sensitivity ingame unless you setup a game profile for it with the mouse software.- Expensive, a less expensive Logitech wireless gaming mouse might be just as good for less money.- Very Short Battery Life (I guess thats why it comes with a charging station)- Does not come with a Gaming Grade Mouse Pad that would reduce the quirkiness of the mouse. It even takes the cake from the Logitech Revolution MX. The Revolution was a bit more comfortable for my large hands, though. It skews to a right-handed person, but it is still comfortable for a left-handed user. The glowing light from the scroll wheel is very, very cool. And the charge stand with its blue glow is equally cool. I am totally geeking out.Some small issues I've had include squirrelly behavior with the high DPI settings. Even with the DPI set lower, the mouse is hyper-sensitive to small movements of wrist, which means that clicks sometimes get translated as click-&-drags.", "qas": [{"id": 113, "question": "Can this mouse scroll right and left?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 3266, "text": "It skews to a right-handed person, but it is still comfortable for a left-handed user."}, {"answer_start": 843, "text": "(They've also killed the scroll wheel - proving they got it right on the MX by accident).The Mamba though is an instant win."}, {"answer_start": 0, "text": "Scroll wheel gears wore out and now the mouse scrolls up when you try to scroll down."}, {"answer_start": 639, "text": "The Mamba is a FANTASTIC mouse with insane precision and control.The ONLY thing I miss from my upgrade was the killer scroll wheel (and clutch) from the Revolution MX."}, {"answer_start": 2168, "text": "I also highly suggest you use a gaming grade mouse pad with this as it will greatly improve your accuracy and reduce quirkiness of the mamba in games.Pros:- Looks really Sexy- Simple firmware update process- 7 buttons (2 left side, 2 small top left *controls sensitivity*, Left MB, Right MB, and Center Mouse Wheel)- Comes with a charging dock that acts as a wireless receiver- 5600 DPI with 1000 hz polling speedCons:- Doesnt work well on some surfaces it will jump around and act quirky- Not accurate when used with a Snipers rifle in FPS games without a gaming grade mouse pad.- The two small top left buttons are for sensitivity ingame unless you setup a game profile for it with the mouse software.- Expensive, a less expensive Logitech wireless gaming mouse might be just as good for less money.- Very Short Battery Life (I guess thats why it comes with a charging station)- Does not come with a Gaming Grade Mouse Pad that would reduce the quirkiness of the mouse."}]}]}
{"context": "I gave away one of my remotes with my original Wii when I upgraded to the Wii U. It is great to have the extra remote again.

{"context": "I gave away one of my remotes with my original Wii when I upgraded to the Wii U. It is great to have the extra remote again. The only thing is that I probably should have gone with a controller with the Wii Plus built in. May be off-brand, but works just as well as a wii brand remote. It connects just fine, and the remote is not cheaply made. it is very well built. I'm glad I purchased it! I have had much bad luck with 3rd party gamecube controllers in the past, but this wiimote is surprisingly reliable. The only differences in quality that i can notice is the nunchuck cord, which is a little more rigid, and the built in microphone sounds a bit more... grainy. I have not had any tracking problems with the 'mote, and the product has yet to break, despite being dropped a few times. I suppose you get what you pay for, and if you just want a second controller to make your friends use but you dont want to pay a lot, I recommend this one. If your going to play a lot spend the extra money and get the official remotes. The official ones gyro motion works a bit better and the hand sensor it much better, this one the hand jitters on the screen. I noticed because i'm a gamer, parents and others didn't notice till i showed them.Negatives-jittery hand motion thru sensor-gyro motion slightly off (still able to play bowling fine)-battery cover doesn't fit tightly, jiggles around a bit but stays on fine and works with AA batteries-using rechargeable batter pack doesn't work, the batter compartment isn't tight enough so it won't get powered (see above statement)Positives-Much cheaper, around 30 bucks cheaper (perfect for kids that break stuff, or if u need a second remote that won't be used often)-I personally like the wrist strap better as it doesn't clip, making it easy to switch people in bowlingWe shall keep this remote and just use rechargeable AA batteries, because it works well enough for the games we play. The remote works fine, but the nunchuck motion didn't work. It was delayed if it worked at all. The thumb button works fine, but I can't use it for motion at all.", "qas": [{"id": 122, "question": "Do these have the wii motion built into the remotes?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 0, "text": "I gave away one of my remotes with my original Wii when I upgraded to the Wii U."}, {"answer_start": 125, "text": "The only thing is that I probably should have gone with a controller with the Wii Plus built in."}, {"answer_start": 345, "text": "it is very well built."}, {"answer_start": 947, "text": "If your going to play a lot spend the extra money and get the official remotes."}, {"answer_start": 222, "text": "May be off-brand, but works just as well as a wii brand remote."}]}]}

Not sure how they afford to sell them this cheap but hope they still have some when I gold one of my other IDs so I can play BF3 again. Shame BF3 requires a code for each ID on XBox that was a low blow! Any way I would seriously recommend this deal to anyone who wants 12 months of Gold, besides why pay more when you can pay less? It is like how canceling AOL after your free month was up was like. A major inconvenience and annoyance besides the fact, if you did not go through with this, you were charged for future services you did not desire.Purchasing this card from Amazon was a synch.1.

Best Buy had an amazing sale on them once but I have not seen it again since.

Imagine my delight to find out that these days you can buy one of these gaming systems and play literally dozens of different games on the same machine. Technology, you are a clever mistress.XBox Live is a terrific system, and I highly recommend it. It allows you to play first-person shooters expertly. Sadly, you cannot play third-person shooters, where you just watch someone else playing the game and go \"wow, he really shot that guy!\" We ordered this this for our sons to share. We found that only one person can be on a membership, not two. So, for us this was a disappointment. IF you truly want to experience the full effect of Halo 4 Black ops 2 or any of the new 1st person shooters you need X-box live, the 12 month gold membership saves you about 60 bucks but ordering it through Amazon saves you about 70.

{"context": "No complaints about this item whatsoever! Definitely worth the small monetary investment. Lets you take a stroll down memory line and enjoy all those old classics. Might be a tad lighter than the original SNES controller but it is structurally sound and has great response time. I've been using the ZSNES emulator and haven't encountered any difficulties with gameplay or ROM/controller compatibility.PURCHASE WITH CONFIDENCE :) It had amazing reviews and most people had the same feelings about the build and quality. I had to order one right away and I was not disappointed.From the moment I got it I ripped open the packaging and held it in my hands. A sudden rush of nostalgia had come over me and I had to try it out. I was able to set it up by simply plugging it into any available USB, launching the emulator of choice, and setting up the controller in preferences. It worked flawlessly! It finally felt right to play all my favorite games with a controller that was true to the original. I bought one of these to try it out with emulators and was thoroughly impressed. The controls are very responsive, they feel just like the original. D-pad is precise in all directions and doesn't feel cheap. In fact, I believe this responds better than the original in my experience. Easy to use, plug and play. Don't settle for the cheaper alternative, this is the one you want. To turn it off again, hold that button and the clear button. The switch happens instantly. You can also hold down the clear button by itself for about a second to completely remove turbo from all buttons, IE reset to default controls. Its usable in fast paced games, and you can always pause the game and then mess with the turbo to your hearts content. Just to be clear for those who don't know, turbo basically spams the button hundreds of times per second when the button is pushed.The price on this controller seems to fluctuate between $13 and $18. I have bought several brands of USB SNES pads over the years, and while they often work, they always have a cheap look and feel. This one is by far the best. I bought two of them for emulator use on my computer and an android gaming device, and they work perfectly for both. It even works on a PS3 if you have the desire.

The plastic on the D-Pad feels a little too thick, which it apparently is in comparison to an original Super Famicom controller, but it handles diagonals without a hitch and I will likely get used to it. I just prefer the D-Pad used on Buffalo's Famicom USB controller, but I will likely register the different D-Pads as different systems, as I would with original controllers.-----TL;DR: My product had minor problems that yours likely won't have, so buy this controller Piece of cake.

And that is pretty sad that Microsoft just couldn't figure out how to implement a decent D-Pad when this $10 controller manages to get it right.

There's even a neat little function in My Wii Fit Plus where you can see the number of calories you've burned in terms of food (you can even choose the type and amount of food you want to burn off and set it as a goal).2) Balance Board improvements. With the old Wii Fit, each time you started a new routine, you'd need to wait for the Balance Board to calibrate. I suppose this was intended in the case where multiple people would be sharing the Balance Board, but it got annoying very fast. We all know it's not good. Most of us need to move more, but exercise can be boring or it could be you're a recluse or too broke to pay for classes, or not in good enough shape to go out in public. This Wii game solves those problems. There are many exercises and routines, and many ways to configure the experience, so you can customize it according to what you like or what you need. Activities are divided into five categories: Yoga, Strength Training, Aerobics, Balance Games and Training Plus, which are games added on to the previous Wii Fit game. I've the Wii Fit Plus since around a month .. it's really lots of fun specially with the Wii Fit training plus .. the whole family is gathered to spend hours playing :) ...I can find it very effective specially for my parents who are over 60 and need beginner and intermediate exercises for their bones and muscles, specially in that cold climate where they can't afford an outdoor walk or exercising.Pros:1- variety of exercises with different levels2- you don't feel that you are exercising but playing a game3- very suitable for all ages specially for old persons who need to train their brains with calculation and concentration and train as well their muscles and point of stabilityCons:1- Needs more aerobics exercises specially STEPS for the the steps fans like me2- Needs variety of Music that the player would chose from them with the exerciseconclusion, i recommend it for those who wants to exercise while having fun There isn't anything wrong with software, but you need a balance board which is nearly impossible to find and absolutely impossible to find without the software included.

Or how about Rhythm Parade where you march and raise and lower your hands on cue and in time with the music? Tilt City has you using your Wiimote turned sideways and the balance board to maneuver dropping balls into one of three color coordinated pails. It's easy at first, but when several different colored balls start dropping at once, it's a challenge. I love the balance games and if you're a fan of the balance board game with the little balls in the first game, there's one here that uses some different colored slots to \"pop\" the balls up over small obstacles and into the hole. i absolutely love this game. of course there will always be room for improvement but they are definitely moving in the right direction given the shortcomings in the original - with the exception of super hula hoop, rhythm boxing and the jacknife or push up challenges i never quite worked up a satisfying sweat or felt that i was truly getting a workout until now. not only that but you can't really underestimate this - i dare you to put your mii in that chicken suit and not turn your arms into spaghetti. the fact that you can customize a workout routine, get an estimation on your calories burned is a welcome addition along with all the new and deceptively challenging games.

{"context": "This is a great tool to get the family exercising if you own the Wii System! It has a huge variety of games, exercises and fun stuff for all ages and encourages lots of activity and family competition!I recommend this program to anyone who wants to get the kids off the violent video games and into some wholesome and fun games and activities while subtly promoting physical health and activity!! !A 5 star rating is appropiate for the Wii Fit Plus CD! I wish there were longer workouts and different workouts on certain exercises, such as the step and the boxing. But this doesn't change my rating at all because I love it and have lost 15 lbs so far. My kids (5,4,2) watch me and they learn how to do it. They also do it and love it and it keeps them active. I would definitely reccommend this product! If you are already a Wii Fit user, this upgrade (DVD only) is well worth the money. For less than $20, you maintain all the original Wii Fit options, plus a lot of new ones. This upgrade brings in your current profile and scores, keeps track of calories burned, adds 15 more games - some are really good for me, others I'm not too interested in. You can customize your workout; however, it only includes Yoga and Strength - that was a bit disappointing, but not worth downgrading this rating. I've had the originalWii Fitfor about a year now and really enjoyed it. The newWii Fit Plushas taken all the original exercises and made them easier to access. Instead of picking out one routine at a time, doing it, then getting your rating, you can now set up your own training session. This really maximizes your time. Also, the new \"fun\" games like cycling, obstacle course & skateboarding are fantastic. The multi-player mode is a great way to get the whole family involved in fitness. I enjoy this WII FIT PLUS tremendously. I really like it that I don't have to insert WII FIT in order for me to use it. It comprises of both WII FIT (I and II) to your workout. I find that this game is much harder than the first one. It's just as much fun as the first one.

{"context": "There is no option for turning this feature OFF. It's incredibly annoying and wastes time that could be used exercising.Lastly, the BMI calculator really does not seem accurate. It does not seem to take into account if someone is very muscular, or what type of frame they have. I am very small, and it thinks I need to weigh 30 more pounds! No way. And it tells my husband, who is muscular from PX90 and Cross Fit training that he is overweight.Overall, it is still a \"fun\" game, especially for kids. We already owned the first Wii Fit and figured we would try this one too. There are a lot more options and the games are more fun. Doesn't seem to get tedious or boring as quickly. Also liked that it pulls your info from the original Wii Fit so you don't have to start all over again. Only real reason for not giving 5 stars is that it seems, like the original, that some of the games have akward movements, and the balance board isn't quite sensitive enough to register them easily resulting in low scores or really high wii fit age even when you have done the motion correctly. I am a Wii Fit fan but there was always frustrations with how fluidly the program could be used. To my satisfaction, these problems have been fixed.I always found it annoying when changing users that you had to go all the way back to the Wii Fit Plaza, in Wii Fit Plus you now have a button to click called Switch. Clicking this will allow you to select a different user. When the other user does a workout all the fit cash goes to their player.Calibrating was always a pain. Wii Fit Plus does not seem to have to re-calibrate the board as much as before.Customised RoutinesYou can now create customised routines, albeit only using the yoga and muscle workouts. If you like Wii Fit, you will like Wii Fit Plus - its that simple. Wii Fit Plus adds a bunch of fun new games (I personally love Rhythm Parade where you march in a band), a calorie counter for each exercise you do, the option to go straight to a list of your favorites, to personalize your own routine, and more. For the price, purchasing this is a no-brainer. If you've gotten a bit bored of Wii Fit, this has enough additions to get you exercising again.The only caveat I have is that, like the original Wii Fit, many of these exercises seem to more catered to those who are beginning to get into an exercise program, or for those who prefer a lower impact less aerobic workout. All the games are definitely fun...but let's state the obvious, why does nintendo continue to limit everything...I want to make a routine using any or all of the exercises. How could they miss something this obvious?They also chose to limit which games should be multiplayer. I don't get it.Don't get me wrong, as a fun game... it's a fun game...but as a workout, it could've been so sweeeet, if they'd just stoplimiting everything.

{"context": "Only bought it because I got myself a new Wii U, and I wanted to upgrade to the newer game to use in the virtual Wii of the Wii U. The Simple test is something I love, sometimes I just need to do a quick weigh in without actually going through all the extra stuff. There is no question about the stamina that Nintendo had drew in with Wii Fit when it came out in 2008. It revolutionized the way we play video games, not just for fun, but getting better in tune with our bodies and exercising better. Since then, Sony & Microsoft have tried to get on the fitness train as well with games for the PS3's Move and Xbox 360's Kinnect. Yet, what they are trying to do, has already been done with the Nintendo Wii. Yet, with Nintendo putting its emphasis onto the upcoming Wii U, that still doesn't mean that it is too late to get a Wii, and get into shape with the sequel to Wii Fit. This is great, I wanted to be able to get moving on the days that I couldn't go to the gym. Some of the exercises and the yoga in general are a joke, but I fell in love with many of the games on it! Looking forward to the next Wii Fit... on Wii U (More money spending...) This was a great addition to my Wii game library. Having purchased the original Wii Fit system, I was excited at the prospect of new balance games especially. My only concern was that I'd have to start all over and open all the excercises back up - not to worry! When you load the game for the first time, it reads your Wii to determine your usage on the original Wii Fit, and uploads all of your time and users automatically. Given my use of the original, I had quite a number of the games/exercises opened immediately. I purchased this game over a week ago and received it today, however when I tried to use it it will not even read at all in my system.

{"context": "I bought the Wii Fit game over a year ago and my friends and family have loved everything that had to offer. But after a year, the games and routines were getting slightly boring. This new edition is everything the old version was and so much more, for the same price. After buying this you can throw out (or donate) your older version. What impresses me about this version is its user friendliness when it comes to creating a workout for yourself. Formerly you had to do each individual exercise and go through an assessment of how you did for each activity (in yoga, aerobics and strength training), now you can create a series of exercises and move from one to the other without the assessment, and without having to press \"A\" ten times between each. Kudos to the developers of the new Wii Fit Plus. I've been enjoying Wii Fit since it came out but this new version is even better than the original. The new challenges are so much fun and you get a great workout. Love the feature of showing you the calories you burn for each exercise. Even us almost 60 folks can get a good workout. Another great feature of this new version is the switching capability. My husband and I are able to switch back and forth between our Mii's to do the exercises. My 74 year old mother is having a ball with these games too. I'm happy it's getting her off her chair and using her mind-body coordination skills, and that she's enjoying herself with each challenge. I would honestly say Wii Fit Plus is for ALL ages. It seems as if fans of the first version had sent in suggestions for creating an updated version and Nintendo listened and incorporated them into their new product. Great job Nintendo! This version of Wii Fit lets you customize your yoga routine. That is important to me and motivates me to use it more. The old version is very difficult to use because you have to keep choosing exercises. I bought Fit plus expecting it to be an advanced version of the original Fit. For the most part it is a 20% add on to the original program. I was hoping for some different and longer versions of the original aerobic exercise routines. For the first time user, however, this version is even better than the original and worth the investment. I was also hoping the program would cut back on the after routine comments as well.

{"context": "The product arrived in a timely manner, but then I went to play the game I had purchased and the 3DS wouldn't turn on. I immediately realized there was no charger cord. A little irritate, because I should have definitely come with a charger cord it's just common sense, I bought one and waited for it to come in the mail as well. It came and I went to the play my game again, and this time it told me that it couldn't recognize the game because there was no SD card. What?! I choose this console due to the fact of my love for pokemon, and it has been so long since I've played it as a little kid. I bought it used from the warehouse thinking that it would come in with a bunch of damage but Wow was I wrong. The 3DS came and it looked brand new, there was no wear or scratches on the devices at all, for the most part all the packaging came with it besides the charger but that can be purchased as most used devices didn't come with the charger. It came with a charger of course. And when she started it up, it walked her through everything so she could understand.She seems to really enjoy the Mii Plaza. So whenever I come to visit we can exchange Mii passes and get to playing the various of games they have to offer.Not only that, she can use this whenever she goes out and pick up other Mii's then just mine. The cradle itself allows you to just set the 3DS in it and charge away. The cradle is pretty cool since the 3DS just slides into it, without having to hook anything up directly to the system, just the charger dock.The 3DS comes with three camera ports. The rear facing camera has two slots since it can take 3D pictures. It isn't the best quality out there, but it is nice to have just in case you need it. The 3D pictures are cool, but will only be viewable in 3DS itself. I haveTom Clancy's Splinter Cell 3DandThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3Dand I highly recommend both. I only have a few minor complaints. One, the charging cradle. I thought it was a wireless charger for car trips or whatever, but it is just an extension that you put the 3DS into. The camera is very low-res, but if you are buying this as a camera, you are kidding yourself. One more thing, old DS games are pixelated.

{"context": "AR games are awesome. You put one of the AR cards down and they come to life using the 3DS. You get to take pictures of the characters, like Mario and Kirby doing different things. The 3DS should get 5 1/2 stars.7 year old says:The 3DS is a really fun system. It's totally 3D, but I can still play my old DS games on it. The part I like best is the AR cards. You point the 3DS at one of the 6 AR cards that come with it, and they come to life on the screen. I was trying to save money this Christmas and therefore purchased a used product. The seller promised near new condition, a stylus, and display. It is in good condition but did not come with the display. It also did not come with an SD card. This was not mentioned at all. Not a big deal as they are only $4 but it was a big deal when my son opened it on Christmas day and could not play any of his new games! I guess I should have known it would not come with one but I'm a mom - not a gamer! You can also see for yourself what comes in the box, but I'll tell you anyway:1 Nintendo 3DS Charging Cradle (which is explained how to use in the Operations Manual)1 Nintendo 3DS system (well, duh!!!! )1 Nintendo 3DS AC adaptor1 Nintendo 3DS stylus (inserted into the system's stylus holder which is located on the back of the Nintendo 3DS system. It is not on the side like the Nintendo DSi)1 2 GB SD Memory Card (inserted into the system's SD card slot)1 pack of \"AR GAMERS\" AR CARDS1. On the DSi you can tag photos and group them into favorite categories. You can draw beards and wigs on people and many more funny things that are not available with the 3DS. My daughter would spend hours playing with this feature of the DSi taking pictures of friends and family and editing the pictures in funny ways. People complain about the poor quality of the DSi camera but some of the pictures I took turned out really well. The DSi also has a Facebook upload capability that you cannot do with the 3DS. To upload your pictures with the 3DS you have to take the memory card out insert it in a computer and upload them manually.Speaking of the memory card a better feature of the 3DS over the DSi is everything is now stored on the memory card instead of some data stored in the console's memory and some stored on the memory card. I played with the circle pad and it was pretty fun, so if you get a 3DS, I definitely recommend that as a game to get along with your system. On a side note, the 3DS also features much better graphics than the past DS systems, comparable to the Wii's.Other Known Features:-3D Camera-AR Card Game-AR Card Arrangement-Face Raiders-Internet Browser-and some more I'm not quite sure of.Black Screen of Death:A known issue with Ubisoft games for the 3DS, after starting a game and playing for a little while, sometimes the screen fades black and usually an error message comes up (which can totally ruin your 3DS), so !!", "qas": [{"id": 154, "question": "does it come with a AR card", "answers": [{"answer_start": 662, "text": "It also did not come with an SD card."}, {"answer_start": 22, "text": "You put one of the AR cards down and they come to life using the 3DS."}, {"answer_start": 359, "text": "You point the 3DS at one of the 6 AR cards that come with it, and they come to life on the screen."}, {"answer_start": 1301, "text": "It is not on the side like the Nintendo DSi)1 2 GB SD Memory Card (inserted into the system's SD card slot)1 pack of \"AR GAMERS\" AR CARDS1."}, {"answer_start": 2421, "text": "On a side note, the 3DS also features much better graphics than the past DS systems, comparable to the Wii's.Other Known Features:-3D Camera-AR Card Game-AR Card Arrangement-Face Raiders-Internet Browser-and some more I'm not quite sure of.Black Screen of Death:A known issue with Ubisoft games for the 3DS, after starting a game and playing for a little while, sometimes the screen fades black and usually an error message comes up (which can totally ruin your 3DS), so !"}]}]}

I love it! I was going to get a DSi but then decided to wait for this to come out & I'm glad I did.For those who are worrying about how it'll affect you if you wear glasses, don't worry.I wear contacts & switch to glasses & I can tell a slight difference on how I have to focus for the 3d, but that's no big deal.I've only played Lego's Star Wars III with 3d so far & really love the depth the 3d gives. I've also played Super Mario Bros. to see how DS games look on it & it does fairly well.Keep in mind when playing DS/DSi games that the resolution on this DS is more than the older ones so it will kinda look stretched, slightly blurry & have some jagged edges on the characters. the 3d effect sucks. if you move your head too much, the 3d starts to fall off. also, the 3d effect is very uncomfortable to experience. i rather play with the 3d off but that defeats the purpose of this device.the lunch titles are also very weak. i don't want to pay $40 to play a zelda remake in 3d. give me some real games!i also think it's too expensive for a marginally better graphics than the dsi. nintendo didn't innovate enough with this generation of portable console. 3D Is pretty nice, haven't actually played a 3DS game on it yet, but played a ds game on it and it played rather nicely, I am so excited for the game line-up. Bought Samurai Warrior Chronicles and SMT:Overclocked! More information later... I do not own the Nintendo 3DS but played it at a Best Buy store. The 3D needs a lot of improving. It is blurry and may cause headaches when the 3D slider is at max. 3D is okay when slider is set at in the middle. But overall it is best played when the 3D is off. So this new handheld from Nintendo is definately not worth $250.

This ds isthe better than all the other ds I EVER had. The 3ds has games that no other ds can have. It has better graphics than any other ds. It inspired me and my friend Brendan make a papermasha Mario character. To see some videos I made go to my YouTube account called rnelson299. When I first received this ds in the mail, I really admired the color because it sparkles. The controls are very simple to use. You can play regular ds games as well as 3ds games on this console. There are many ways to customize and there are other features that include a camera, sound recorder, games and programs you can download to your ds including netflix. What can I say? I love this freaking thing. I had a ds lite and I basically played one game: Mario kart. That was it for the most part. Even on that tiny screen, the graphics were pixelated. Then I got a psp and the ds lite sat in a drawer for a year until I gave it to a friend's kid. I felt that the original DS was a joke in all it's iterations. This system is a HUGE improvement in every, way, shape, and form.SYSTEM: It's portable, the hardware is a lot more solid than ds lite. I will start off by saying, this is a great product. I bought Pokemon Black and I bought Pilot Wings Resort, and the 3D worked well. Pokemon Black was released for the old DS so 3D doesn't work on it naturally, but the graphics are perfectly fine on without it. To the actual 3D of this thing now. It works great, I had some serious doubts about how well the 3D would work, but it really does work really well.

You don't ever have to power down the 3DS, just close the lid, cradle and it will recharge while it's in that state, which is pretty sweet.Here is a beef you may not like. The 3DS offers backwards compatibility to your DS/DSi games so they can be played. The drawback? The 3DS has completely different screen resolution so in order to make it \"fit\" on the screen, it must stretch the image. The cradle itself allows you to just set the 3DS in it and charge away.

There's tons of mini games implanted into every detail of this thing.Mii Maker: Same as the Wii's Mii feature. Make characters and save them.

Otherwise the gameplay is very promising, I'm hoping that Nintendo will release some its staple franchises for it within the near future as the launch titles are a bit sparse. So far, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Star Fox are supposedly on the release slated for it early this summer. Definitely a step-up in the hand held gaming world! Let's hope Nintendo has the necessary third party support to make this system shine! ), Pseudo-surround sound, Cool pre-loaded games and software, backwards compatibility, 3D camera (low rez though .3MP), 2GB included MicroSD card, MP3 playing capability, drop-in charging cradle (SOOOO convenient). *not available as of this writing, but scheduled for a May update.CONS: Battery life, speakers don't get very loud, game crashes, limited color options (which may not be a problem if you love the aqua blue like I do), no GBA slot (oh well, I guess with the DSiWare store it won't be necessary), lastly - the inexplicable crashes. It is actually one of my favorite things about the 3ds. The controls are very smooth and it responds very well. I was a little wary of it since I'd never heard of the circle pad before, but no worries here!- pedometer app is very handy. Its not a necessary thing, but it is nice to have it since I carry the 3ds around most of the time anyway. It is an excellent motivation to walk more when you open up your 3ds and it shows how many steps you've taken already that day.- the color of the outside...The first time I saw the 3ds is person, I was shocked at the color. got the consumers before the holiday at a higher price because they knew they'd pay it since it was the only new \"hot\" handheld on the market and available for Christmas gifting, then lowered the MSRP when the Vita came out to have a price based competitive edge)... it could be, but it also could be that it wasn't selling well enough and they realized a drop in price was necessary.... I haven't done enough economic research to have insight into their motives. Regardless, I'd feel duped if I had bought it early at full price.Anyway, the Vita has the edge on online gaming given the 3G data plan option (although the 3DS does have the cool street pass element, as did the DSi, and you can online game with the 3DS via its own wifi), and the 3G Vita system is worth it for $50 more if you ever want to use that feature. Unlike the Vita, the memory cards are not proprietary. So you can buy a cheap 32 GB micro SD card, get and adapter for it and use that, instead of being forced to pay 100 dollars if you want a 32 GB's. If you want to transfer music or other things to the DS, your computer will need a SD memory card slot since the 3DS doesn't have any USB connection.

{"context": "It's impressive enough that it no longer can be judged as a 'gimmick' because it helps to immerse the gamer deeper into the experience of the game. Sure, there is the option to switch to 2D mode but I think my point is that once you see the games in 3D, you won't want to switch back to 2D. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I felt that the screen resolution could be better. Overall though, I am impressed with this 3D portable gaming console... the first of it's kind. And if that doesn't work for you, turn 3D off. The system is marvelous and has many things on it that look superb even in 2D.3DS CAMERA: 8 out of 10The Nintendo 3DS has 3 cameras. Two of them take 3D pictures, and one takes pictures of the player facing the screen. The cameras are not good quality. I've seen a few cell phones that are better. But you can take 3D PHOTOS! I'd take a almost decent 3D Photo then a average 2D goo photo. I'd give the camera a 4, but the way you can edit photos and see them in 3D makes it an 8.3DS SOUND: 10 out of 10One of my favorite things about the Nintendo 3DS is the 3DS Sound. O.k. i'm no expert with DSi's but my kids have them from DS, DSi, and the 3Ds. My kids don't use the 3d mode because it gives them headaches or hurts their eyes or looks weird. Some of their friends say the same. I tried to use the 3d mode and it made my eyes cockeyed. I personally don't think the 3d mode on this unit is a good thing for a childs eye and brain development coupled with the hours on end playing on a small screen. I mean you do get some 3d effect, but it still has a way to go because the way it is now your eyes and brain can't process it just right. And still, I think most 3DS games are worth it, even if you play them in 2D because they're going to be made specifically for it, not for the DS, so that means better controls, graphics, more space for more content, more possibilities, more power, etc. So I hate it when people are just like \"Oh, just buy a DS Lite instead, cause it's totally the same as the 3DS if you play in 2D mode,\" you know cause it's NOT. There's a reason they didn't make the new Mario game that's being made by the same people who made Super Mario Galaxy, for the 3DS and not the DS.Also, I really doubt that most of these people are Real Gamers because seriously, I don't know a single real gamer that would have a problem with the \"Sweet Spot\" because they move their head too much. AR Games has you aim the 3DS camera at the AR Card (Pre-packaged) to make game such as Archery and Fishing on your kitchen table. Face Raiders allows you to take pictures of friends or family and turn them into enemies and shoot them down in the real world using the camera and gyrometer. Mii Maker lets you make Miis just by taking picures of them as well as from scratch. StreetPass Mii Plaza collects Miis found with StreetPass, a feature that trades data with other 3DS's in sleep mode, and use them in a RPG-type game as well as a puzzle mode.", "qas": [{"id": 160, "question": "Is there a way to turn off the 3D effect while playing, ie a 2D mode?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 148, "text": "Sure, there is the option to switch to 2D mode but I think my point is that once you see the games in 3D, you won't want to switch back to 2D."}, {"answer_start": 492, "text": "And if that doesn't work for you, turn 3D off."}, {"answer_start": 1540, "text": "I mean you do get some 3d effect, but it still has a way to go because the way it is now your eyes and brain can't process it just right."}, {"answer_start": 865, "text": "I'd take a almost decent 3D Photo then a average 2D goo photo."}, {"answer_start": 1931, "text": "So I hate it when people are just like \"Oh, just buy a DS Lite instead, cause it's totally the same as the 3DS if you play in 2D mode,\" you know cause it's NOT."}]}]}
{"context": "Before I get to the review portion, let me first say that I have the Aqua Blue version and am very happy with the system, it's fantastic.The 3DS was first heard of early last year when there were patents discovered from Nintendo about 3DS and 3DSiware and whatnot. Then at E3, it made it's official debut to talk about what the system is, what it can do, what games will we see, etc. This was followed by Press events in Japan, Europe, and US to talk about more details about the 3DS as it relates to their respective region.So what is the 3DS? The system is region locked (which is not a big deal for many but it is for those who are into importing their games). The battery life is horrifically terrible. Barely 5 hours on a full charge with the 3D effect off from what I understand. Also, yes it plays DS games, but the top screen when playing DS games have black bars on the side.Verdict:If you can help it, do NOT trade in your old DS system, you may find yourself using it for the better battery life (I use my XL, 3 times the battery life). 'Nuff said.3DS Sound App: 5/10Sadly you'll need to use 3rd Party Software to convert your music to run on the 3DS just like with the DSi. I understand Nintendo's fear of the RIAA (Record Industry Association of America) but forcing me to hack my own Music Library is a bit of a stretch. Fortunately the music I hacked for my DSi plays fine on the 3DS. When I say hacked I mean I used 3rd Party Software (Legal Software) to convert DRM-Protected songs into a 3DS-compatable format. The DS camera can be used to create your Mii and integrate you or your friends faces into some games. I've really enjoyed the free games thus far, and I'm nowhere near unlocking them all.Rural Adaptations: Nintendo is finally realizing that America is not as densely populated as Japan, and has added some side steps to enjoy \"3DS to 3DS\" perks without having your 3DS communicate with others. Although it's a little lengthy, rural gamers can get \"coins\" simply by carrying their 3DS around that they can spend to get some of the perks that you would usually get from 3DS to 3DS communication.Game Play: It's completely different, and I'm loving it. that shrinks the image down some, but with no pixelation. This is the only reason I didn't give it a perfect rating. Otherwise the gameplay is very promising, I'm hoping that Nintendo will release some its staple franchises for it within the near future as the launch titles are a bit sparse. So far, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Star Fox are supposedly on the release slated for it early this summer. Definitely a step-up in the hand held gaming world! Let's hope Nintendo has the necessary third party support to make this system shine!", "qas": [{"id": 161, "question": "is it region locked  if it is which region America  / Europe / Australia", "answers": [{"answer_start": 545, "text": "The system is region locked (which is not a big deal for many but it is for those who are into importing their games)."}, {"answer_start": 384, "text": "This was followed by Press events in Japan, Europe, and US to talk about more details about the 3DS as it relates to their respective region.So what is the 3DS?"}, {"answer_start": 1186, "text": "I understand Nintendo's fear of the RIAA (Record Industry Association of America) but forcing me to hack my own Music Library is a bit of a stretch."}, {"answer_start": 1631, "text": "I've really enjoyed the free games thus far, and I'm nowhere near unlocking them all.Rural Adaptations: Nintendo is finally realizing that America is not as densely populated as Japan, and has added some side steps to enjoy \"3DS to 3DS\" perks without having your 3DS communicate with others."}, {"answer_start": 2179, "text": "that shrinks the image down some, but with no pixelation."}]}]}

Regardless of the 3DS's headstart the Vita has been out for awhile and I'm not seeing the support I thought I would.

What can I say? I love this freaking thing. I had a ds lite and I basically played one game: Mario kart. That was it for the most part. Even on that tiny screen, the graphics were pixelated. Then I got a psp and the ds lite sat in a drawer for a year until I gave it to a friend's kid. I felt that the original DS was a joke in all it's iterations. This system is a HUGE improvement in every, way, shape, and form.SYSTEM: It's portable, the hardware is a lot more solid than ds lite. This ds isthe better than all the other ds I EVER had. The 3ds has games that no other ds can have. It has better graphics than any other ds. It inspired me and my friend Brendan make a papermasha Mario character. To see some videos I made go to my YouTube account called rnelson299. When I first received this ds in the mail, I really admired the color because it sparkles. The controls are very simple to use.

{"context": "The game welcomes new players to Hitman, but if these players still happen to have a last-gen console, they should pick up those editions of the series, as well. This involves a player choosing multiple targets or different targets, with a specific or any weapon, and method of escape. Players performing these hits get points and these values are displayed globally. This would appeal to anybody that like leaderboard games.I played this game twice and decided to trade it in afterwords. It took me about a week to play the game averaging about 3 hours a day. The characters are also all to similar to each another. I would have preferred a greater variety of targets than just drug dealers and rednecks. By comparison, Blood Money featured a much classier and diverse set of targets and in settings such as a vineyard, an opera house, the suburbs, and a casino -- much grander venues than the seedy hotels and even seedier strip clubs of a run-down Chicago in Absolution.I have maybe partaken in one or two \"contracts\" in the online segment of the game and did not have much fun. During the campaign, it is best to find as many weapons, items, and disguises as possible, so they will not have to be purchased in this mode.GAMEPLAY: The game is powered by the Glacier 2 engine, which is highlighted by the physics of CPU AI movements. The movements of 47 are very swift and responsive. In fact, many of 47's movements can be compared to how Sam Fisher's movements are in the Splinter Cell games, which means players can now access cover and look around at a 360 angle. Absolution follows a story line, so sometimes you are sneaking your way through a somewhat directed level (i.e. you have to go through point A and point B to get to C), sometimes you are running away from certain people, and finally the best moments are when you have targets to kill. For the first two is where criticism sinks comes in but if the mission is to kill targets...boy... there's no other game like it. You'll always have multiple ways to kill your targets and there'll be plenty of opportunities as well.", "qas": [{"id": 163, "question": "can it play two players", "answers": [{"answer_start": 489, "text": "It took me about a week to play the game averaging about 3 hours a day."}, {"answer_start": 1855, "text": "For the first two is where criticism sinks comes in but if the mission is to kill targets...boy... there's no other game like it."}, {"answer_start": 286, "text": "Players performing these hits get points and these values are displayed globally."}, {"answer_start": 0, "text": "The game welcomes new players to Hitman, but if these players still happen to have a last-gen console, they should pick up those editions of the series, as well."}, {"answer_start": 1387, "text": "In fact, many of 47's movements can be compared to how Sam Fisher's movements are in the Splinter Cell games, which means players can now access cover and look around at a 360 angle."}]}]}

You won't regret it! i love hitman games. the story is dull and repetitive. the graphics are amazing i will give it that game play is stunning. had this game been contracts it would of been great. its a ok game if you like running and hiding from cops for half the game This is coming from a dedicated fan of the series. This game is a huge downer. It is so broken I returned it back for a couple bucks at a used game store. The disguise system is highly flawed (instead of blending in, a disguise now turns everyone with that same disguise against you). Dummest idea and makes no sense to the idea of a disguise.Oh, and most of the game is highly linear instead of open, which is also no fun. This game does a phenomenal job of giving you plenty of options. I would play through each level multiple times going guns blazing, or as a silent assassin, or by using only weapons i found throughout the levels. I would then spend a good amount of time perfecting the hitman kills through the ways that I was actually supposed to in order to get a high score. This game is very innovative and fun to play. My only complaints are that the story is quite lack luster and killing random enemies doesnt hurt your score enough. What i really appreciate about the series is the variety of every mission. there's no one way to complete them and the replay value to try different approaches is why i find this game to be fun.", "qas": [{"id": 164, "question": "the game is a physical cd? or is a code to download it?", "answers": [{"answer_start": 49, "text": "Also, if you're a Playstation Plus subscriber, the game is currently free to download, however its definitely worth purchasing."}, {"answer_start": 498, "text": "This game is a huge downer."}, {"answer_start": 321, "text": "had this game been contracts it would of been great."}, {"answer_start": 1232, "text": "This game is very innovative and fun to play."}, {"answer_start": 0, "text": "I'm so happy to have this game in my collection."}]}]}

{"context": "After the first several hours of use with consistent mouse settings, it is very easy to put the pointer pretty much exactly where you want it. Stopping the mouse mid swipe is easy as well. Its performance is also extremely consistent. I have only had the mouse cursor jump once in my entire ownership of the mouse, and even then, it was not a major glitch. Upon putting the mouse down after picking it up, the cursor moves very little from its original location, and this can be corrected with little to no effort. * If you like simple mice and are looking for an actual top of the line \"yet still mid-range-priced\" mouse, here it is. Emphasis on simple, it's small and has 3 buttons in total. * 4/5 stars - if it were a big bigger it might have felt to be more comfortable. Lack of now-classic 2-set of buttons on the side is disappointing for mouse of this price. That said, for the price, it's an amazing gaming mouse. Great backup for lans or for a laptop on the go. If your like me and you've been using the same old mouse for ages your playing league of Legends one day and despite your best efforts to smart cast or flash over the wall for freedom you get caught by dumb stuff. Its time to upgrade. The mouse does take some getting use to. Its litterally so much faster and responsive than my mouse was even on the lowest settings. I moved to the mid range level. I told myself I must adapt. After using it for some time I totally fell in love. After a long day of computing, my mouse hand will be very soar. To be fair, I am a big guy at 6'5&#34; and that likely exacerbates this problem. This last fact is the reason I gave it 3 stars and not 2. In sum:Pros: toggle switches are nice for switching between gaming and computer work; it looks cool; the mouse wheel is one of the best I've used (very tactile and wide); chord is very flexible (not stiff like some I've used).Cons: very small for a &#34;full-sized&#34; mouse; size, flatness, and recessed buttons lead to little to no support for your palm; definitely not good for people with big hands or for long periods of use. I got this mouse because of the small size and the lack of excess buttons, and its fantastic. Its nice and small so its great for playing claw-grip style and the laser is great so im able to quickly swing all over the screen with accuracy. The finish on the top of the mouse alongside its small, comfortable ambidextrous design make it very comfortable to use. The mouse wheel is small, low and very quit.

{"context": "Personally, this is just a tad TOO simplistic for my liking... considering this is a freakin' gaming mouse. *DPI customization works great, you can tell a large difference with all 3 modes. No complaints here. Good placement, never switched on me by accident.Personal Notes:*The chord never bothered me. It's of high quality as noted early, it is all Razer materials, so I doubt it will ever tangle in a way that will become hard to undo. *This mouse is small and simplistic. This mouse has three DPI settings, 450, 1800, and 3500 and polling from 125Hz to 1000Hz. On 450 DPI and 125Hz polling, it's very similar to my old Logitech mouse -- not too sensitive, like many other gaming mice.The buttons have a neat concave design, so your fingers can't slip off the sides and rest nicely in the center. They also are fairly long, so your fingers can rest farther back on the mouse or far forward toward the front, depending on the grip you use.The scroll button has nice ridges for traction, though it's a bit stiff for using as a third mouse button, but you get used to it fairly quickly.It's got a nice long cable that doesn't get tangled.My only real cons are:The long buttons have long ridges along the left and right side that get dirty fairly easily.It has a nifty blue light on the back that fails to turn off when the computer is shut off. The box and packaging really makes me feel like I've joined the \"Cult of Razer.\" The free sticker propaganda was a nice touch. Their marketing is amazing, and I can see why the company is doing so well.I really don't care that the cord isn't braided; many find this to be a good thing. The USB connector isn't gold plated but I really don't care about that either. The only thing that is somewhat annoying is that the LED light always stays on, even after your computer it completely shut down. This is a very popular mouse among many gamers.I prefer the Deathadder 2013 ergonomics over this one, but I just needed another mouse for laptop when I'm not at home.Works great, but doesn't come up on the synapses 2.0, which isn't really necessary.You can uses the switches on the bottom for DPI and freq, but the default are great on 6/7. This \"feature\" diminishes my enjoyment of the product.I have looked up the issue on Google, and to my disappointment, the only fix is quite hackish. People have guides on how to open your mouse, disconnect the LED, or tape over the back with black tape. I don't want to perform surgery on my mouse just so I can enjoy it.

The mouse has 3 DPI settings which is nice. Love the feel of this mouse. And best of all, the price exceeds expectations for the quality of the mouse. Pros:Good looking, cheap, ambidextrous, cool flashing LED, smooth movement on any surface, quiet but satisfying clicks, hardy incremental scroller that is great for shooters, polling rate and dpi switches on the bottom.Cons: Can't turn LED off (I dont want to but some others do). Small, so dont get it if you have large hands. It's great for us small handed people though.Overall probably the best gaming mouse for the price on the market. Pros:Mouse moves smoothly, with decently quiet clicks. Very sturdy. Hz and DPI buttons on bottom work well and are very solid, though I rarely change them.Support Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1.It's a little smaller than average, so it fits people with hands of about any size. I personally have fairly large hands and never have issues using it for long periods of time.No extra mouse buttons...Great mouse for shooters (BF3/CoD) and click-intensive games (Diablo 3, Torchlight, etc).Cons:Bright blue Razer emblem on mouse might annoy some people... Love this mouse so far.I did open it up and remove the LED light as that really messes with the gorgeous design of this mouse.This mouse works flawlessly as long as your not the type of person who squeezes the mouse really heard I bet that would cause some problems as it is very basic and not built like a tank.If your looking for a no nonsense high dpi mouse with a decent price you are looking at it. This is a very inexpensive mouse and a great entry level gamer's mouse. I really have no complaints other than it's a bit too small for my hand (but I quickly adapted). It is very lightweight, very responsive and good value. Razer are one of few companies to make truly ambidextrous mice that can be configured for lefties. Thank you for that.Addendum.

This is my 1st razer product, and I am actually pretty happy with my purchase. I wanted to get a more sensitive gaming mouse so I can play SC2 with. I found 30 bucks to be a decent price for a gaming mouse and I opt to buy this mouse.

There are no jumps and i have mine set at 450 by 1800dpi. One problem I had with it was that the bright LED Razor symbol light never turned off.

{"context": "I have no found a solution as to why Razer or the softer provide a setting to turn this light on and off. It is a big ridiculous. Also another con. The 4th days using the mouse. with Super light game play mind you. The scroll wheel makes really loud and bothersome noise when going in the down direction only. I also have not found a solution to fix this, also I have noticed people having this problem, they had sent it back and still the replacements did the same. I don't think this can be fixed either, which is a big bummer.I still do love this mouse, it is great! (3) High DPI and reporing rate: well this is actually not very special as a gaming mouse... as long as you do not compare it to MS IE3 :)And here are some defects I find:(1) Mousewheel is hard to use. If you always use the wheel to read long webpages, I guess you would suffer a little bit...(2) Right click has a weird feeling, compared to the perfect left click. It makes noise and has longer key distance. Despite its lacking back and forward side mouse buttons, the mouse's clicking ability is just phenomenal. It's not too loud, not too quite (I like to hear feedback).The mouse's is also extremely light. Ever since its opening, I haven't bothered to unwind the excess cabling from the mouse.If you can't afford something more expensive , or you need a somewhat minimum mouse, this will definitely cater to your needs. I love this mouse, I use it not only to play World of Tanks, but also checking email and working on projects. The left and right mouse buttons are nice and responsive don't click loud as well. The scroll wheel is exceptional as well but does make a louder sound than my older cheap mouse but at least it works.It took me awhile to actually find the right Abyssus software, but I found it eventually.The thing that I HATE is the blue light, I can't seem to turn it off.

Despite this being a gaming mouse, I've really not done a lot of gaming and treated this quite gently always. (other reviewers have complained about the same thing and now I've personally encountered the exact same issue). Also I noticed that whenever the mouse does this, not only is it incredibly annoying, but somehow mouse-clicks (especially left clicks) become intermittent and sometimes only register after several repeated clicks. I swapped out a standard Dell mouse and didn't have this same sets of problems. This particular Razer Abyssus model is totally useless and the drivers/software also isn't fully compatible with Windows 7 64bit. You have no option to turn it off. Even if you shut down your computer, it will not turn off unless you cut the power completely off your computer. It's kind of ridiculous that there are cheaper mouses out there from less known companies that have better software for their mouses.Fortunately, 1800 DPI and 1000Hz polling rate is good enough for me but I really wish Razer would make this mouse compatible with their Synapse 2.0. Half of the mouse is the mouse itself, but the other half is its software. The Abyssus is lighter than the Deathadder and it allows me to move the mouse a lot easier. The size factors in its precision as well.I'd love to give this mouse a 5/5, but there's a huge flaw to this mouse and that is its software. It is not compatible with Razer Synapse 2.0 and its own software gives limited customization. You have a mouse capable for going to 3500 DPI, yet you only have 3 choices at which DPI you can play on. The light is also an annoying issue. This is a great mouse for $30. It is great as a claw/fingertip mouse. It has quick changeable buttons on the bottom for dpi and response rate. I have had many razer products and not one of them has failed on me, even though they do feel cheaper than Logitech products. The reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that it jitters on some mouse pads.

The console honestly needs at least 14-16 GB for avid gamers, which will set you back yet another whopping $60 for the 16 GB Vita SD card. To put this into perspective, that would bring your total Vita purchase up to nearly $380 after tax. The fact that Sony decided against providing any memory in the console itself was ridiculous; the 3DS may not have much storage space, but at least you don&#8217;t have to pay extra for it right off the bat. While there are bundles and starter kits that do in fact come along with the card, you&#8217;ll have to be willing to throw down the extra cash (and/or be interested in the games they come with), and most of these only come with the very limiting 4 GB.Regardless of these assets and setbacks, the number one thing on the average gamer&#8217;s mind for a console are the games. Without a memory card, the PSV is basically useless. You cannot download anything and some apps that come on the PSV will not even load without a memory card. Another problem with her is that the cards are really expensive. A 32GB card is $100. That is really expensive and the prices need to come down.So overall, this handheld is definitely worth buying if you are in the market of getting a handheld, this should be your number one choice. It has a solid launch line-up and finally got the design of the actual device right this time. For storage, I had to buy a proprietary 8 gig memory card which is a bit overpriced. I could understand that there may be standardized card speeds that Sony is implementing to optimize the Vita's performance but they are still on the expensive side. And I think 8 Gig is the minimum if you planning on downloading game demos and other items from the PS Store.The retail games also come in a tiny SD card sized cartridge with a relatively, ridiculously oversized case.
